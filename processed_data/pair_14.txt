Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.

You gotta idea, spit it out.

Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.

Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
I don't know anybody.
I don't know anybody.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Why!
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
He asked.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Of course.
Of course.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows: what you look like, what your first name is, where you're from and what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow

If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If we don't, he'll die.
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
That fuckin did it!
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
Is that supposed to be funny?
We don't think this place is safe.
We don't think this place is safe.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
So you wanna git bit, huh?
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground! I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
You takin' his side?
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit... And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy... And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
What are you gonna do about him?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
This is what he was doin'.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
There's a slight difference.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Not these guys.
Yeah, those guys too.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Maybe he did.
Maybe he did.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Who shot who?
Nobody. The light was bad.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her -- And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Tell them to come on in.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It doesn't matter who they are.
And one of 'em is sick.
And one of 'em is sick.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Anybody hurt?
No. We came down the hill a little fast and... ...the wheel broke. Can you fix it for us?
What's the matter with her?
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
This must have been in the family a long time.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
And this is Helen Carter.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
You can't leave us here.
You can't leave us here.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can stay here if you like.
You can stay here if you like.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Our kind of women?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
What's the matter with her?
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
And this is Helen Carter.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
So am I.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
But you eat, don't you?
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Where do you keep the can opener?
In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Go on, there's a good boy.
There's a nice boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Like what?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
He's learning his letters.
He's learning his letters.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
They're stragglin'.
His letters will keep.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Hold on.
Hold on.
We can't stay here!
We can't stay here!
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Coffee?
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I hope so, too.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I suppose it is.
I suppose it is.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Thanks.
Thanks.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
The who?
The who?
You should know. She's in your dream.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
Will she be dark or fair?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
He knows his alphabet.
That's fine.
Are we leaving?
It's too light yet.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You're not going out to look for them?
You're not going out to look for them?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Don't you trust me?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Why do you think?
Why do you think?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
So that's it -- You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
Tell me, darling.
What?
What?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All right -- it's said!
All right -- it's said!
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
I suppose that's my fault.
All my clothes --
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
I won't have you fighting over me.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
It's going to Sonora.
It's going to Sonora.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Hurry up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Maybe they will.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Goodbye, Mary.
Goodbye, Mary.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Thanks for taking over.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
Where you going?
To the other side of the street.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Why?
Why?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
I haven't got the job yet.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
I found their surrey --
So did I. They were in it.
So did I. They were in it.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
Hello, Miss Wells.
I -- lost something.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Which ranch?
Which ranch?
How's that?
I can't --
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
No they won't.
How does she draw?
A little hot.
That's right.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Who's Lednov?
A man I used to know.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
Like what?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
I don't want to run short.
I don't want to run short.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
Nice.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
What was he in jail for?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?
In a fight?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
This is an awful nice gun. Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will?
Yes.
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
All right. I'll tell you.
That's Lednov! We come along here.
And meet him there.
And meet him there.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
I've got eleven horses.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Where'd they go?
Swimming.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
How'd you happen to miss?
How'd you happen to miss?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Good thing you didn't.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
That's right, Steve.
That's right, Steve.
Can I have my gun back?
Can I have my gun back?
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
I won't again.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, it does.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Finished, son?
Finished, son?
There's only two of them now.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- -- go back and watch the horses.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
You better start.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
Go on, hit me.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You know what she asked me?
I don't care what she asked you.
I don't care what she asked you.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
You want to split up? --
Half of them are mine.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
What did you come back for?
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
How's that?
Kind of sore.
Kind of sore.
You'll live.
You'll live.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
You can light the lamp. I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Three men on matched roans?
Yeah, how did you know?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
All right, you didn't know.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
You're not bein' quite fair.
What's there to be fair about?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
All right, you didn't know.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
You're not bein' quite fair.
What's there to be fair about?
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
I said I didn't care.
I said I didn't care.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Don't act so -- crazy.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
He won't take us. Don't you want us around?
He won't take us. Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
It isn't that --
It isn't that --
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
But I want to stay.
But I want to stay.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself. Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Stop it -- stop it.
Stop it -- stop it.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Go away -- please.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
You got no business snoopin' around --
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
That something I shouldn't see?
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
That sure smells good.
I like it.
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Then why stay in the hills.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Plenty more. And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Well, say it.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Some people who went by this way lost it. Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Some people who went by this way lost it. Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
And you're all alone.
Yeah.
Suppose I take a look.
Go ahead.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
They went on like I told you.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?
Depends on how good you drive.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
They shouldn't have done that.
They shouldn't have done that.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.

I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Goodbye and thanks.
I don't like to see you go.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works. Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe in Sonora.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Now where's she goin'? --
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
We don't want to go there.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
You're not giving up?
How many ways can a man say no.
Maybe I better start working on him.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Go on. Have another try at him.
What's the use.
What's the use.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
We might as well start a fire.
Go ahead. Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
I'm sure of this. But not of you. You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
That's it then.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
I don't care what he thinks.
How do you know who we are?
Everybody knows --
Everybody knows --
Who brought you here?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Stop it --
Clay Phillips.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Up the trail.
How far up the trail?
I don't know -- I don't know.
We got to get movin'.
What for?
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
Because there's a man I want to see.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
I said let's go.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
We got company. Female company.
Yeah, we sure have.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Put on another one.
Put on another one.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
What are you doin' --
Lookin' around.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am. We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
I was at first. Then I was hanging on. Are you going far?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Don't you even know your letters?
Would you like to learn them?
I sure would.
I sure would.
Maybe I could start you out.
Maybe I could start you out.
That'd be swell. You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
You're so nice.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Good night, Steve.
Gee, I can't.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Aren't we stayin'?
No. We're not stayin' --
What comes after Z?
That's the end of the line.
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
Then I know my alphabet.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
What do they look like?
What do they look like?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
No.
No.
How about California?
How about California?
Would they be good to eat?
Would they be good to eat?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I feel good anyways.
Well, Steve?
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
And you've got me all figured out?
And you've got me all figured out?
Sure.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
You were supposed to be reading words.
You were supposed to be reading words.
I was doin' both. Here.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
But you're his brother.
But you're his brother.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
It's a long ways yet. I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Thanks, Steve.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Steve --
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
If you need me, I'll be --
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I

No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I found a picture of his wife.
I found a picture of his wife.
Wife?!
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?... Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
I think he wants me.
I think he wants me.
Ha! Right bitch!
No, I won't let you do it.
Alex, what are you doing?
Alex, what are you doing?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Hey, Brenda.
Do I know you?
Do I know you?
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Me, too. 101?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
That's it.
That's it.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Never happened!
My favorite memory was when we --
Would you die already?!
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.

Really? That's amazing.
Really? That's amazing.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.

Thanks.
Thanks.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
Psychology.
Ouch!!
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Help!
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Oh my God! We're dead!
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
It's coming!
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Hey, I have an idea...
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Okay.
Cindy, what's going on?
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.

Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
Hello Brenda.
Hello Ray.
Shhh... It's okay.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
So, I guess I can go now.
No, stay.
No, stay.
You sure?
You sure?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Yeah, me too.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's right. I should go first.
He's so brave.
Where's Shorty?
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Ray, run faster.
Okay.
Hey, you left your book back there.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Maybe we can study together or something.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Hi Buddy.
Open chest!!!
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Okay.
Buddy...
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Shhh!
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Alright!
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Let's get outta here.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Hugh Kane.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And
That we should take our friendship a little further?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Yes...
Yes...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
I was thinking the same thing.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Great!!!
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Huh?
What about you, Buddy?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
He's here.
Shit!
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
No. Try a little higher.
Feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
Better try a little higher.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Cindy, let me...
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
There's something I really want to share with you.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.

Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Oh.
Oh.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Then what are we going to do?
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Let's get a hot dog.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah. Can I borrow five bucks?
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
Are you okay?
I think so.
I think so.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
Okay, I get the point.
So, whatever happened to her?
So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.
Let her go, Cin.
But he'll kill her!
But he'll kill her!
That means more screen time for us.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
It's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
It's the sequel.
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
How about these buns?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Right behind you.
Where's Shorty?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Cindy.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Hanson, please.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Stop touching his brain!
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Not in a thousand years.
Stop! --
Made you say it!
It was you...
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
Both of them?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
This can't be happening?
This can't be happening?
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Noooo!!!
Yes!!!!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
I don't need your help.
What the hell are you doing?
Just wait, you'll see.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
What are we gonna do?
We have to destroy him.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I'll go.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there. Nobody wants to go.
Alright, let's take a vote...
Father!
My child, you're alive!
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
We? What do you mean... we?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
My child you are the only survivor.
My child you are the only survivor.
No, my friends are right here!
I'm sorry.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
You could use the grade, huh?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Huh?
Huh?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Am I cool now?
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Aww, the little bird died.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, I got an idea.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Did you do that?
Uh, uh.
Uh, uh.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
Are you?
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Got my camera right here.
I got it!
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Theo, did you see the animal?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
What are you getting at, Professor?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Got a problem with that?
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I wouldn't go that far.
I don't like this, this...
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Who?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Saw who?!
Saw who?!
Don't touch me!!
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Let me help you.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Here you go, Professor.
Are these all the subjects?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Any of them hot?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.

That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
What's this?
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.

Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.

How are we going to get them all up there?

I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.

And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?

In about fifteen minutes.
In about fifteen minutes.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Right. What about condoms?
Right. What about condoms?
Professor!
Professor!
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.

Would you please focus?

Fine. What's all this stuff?
Fine. What's all this stuff?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Even in the bathroom?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
That one.
That one.
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
My God! Is she dead?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
The image there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What the hell?!
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Professor, we need to talk.
What is it, Dwight?
What is it, Dwight?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What?
What?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.

That's why we came here, remember?
That's why we came here, remember?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
I can do it myself.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
The keys. She took the keys.
Hello Dwight.
Hi.
What are you working on?
Just a little experiment.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You do.
You do.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
And sexy.
And sexy.
Of course. So sexy.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Just a little Rogaine.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
That's right.
That's right.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Oh, I couldn't do that.
She's right. We should stick together.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Thanks, handyman.
Thanks, handyman.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Yours, or the turkeys?
Yours, or the turkeys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Second best.
You never could feel your legs.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine. I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Alright... I might need your help.
My help?
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
You mean to tell me we're dead!
I guess so.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Father, come in, please.
I'm so glad you're here.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
It's okay. I understand.
It's okay. I understand.
How is she?
How is she?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Father.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Would you like to see the girl?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Father, are you okay?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?
Yes.
Yes.
Then let us prepare.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Because she will lie?
Because she will lie?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
What?
What?
What she said about your mother?
No thanks.
My holy water.
Father, I think you should rest.
No, I'm fine.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Yo son, check this out.
Dog, you look hot.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
This part removes the sense of humor.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...

Don't worry, I got your back.
BLOOD FEAST!
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Oh, boy!
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Did you hear?
What happened?
What happened?
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
What a bitch!
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??...
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??...
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother?
Mother?
0h, shit!
0h, shit!
You don't think...
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Is MOM... in there?
Is MOM... in there?
No! It wasn't like gore movies at all! IT WAS REAL!
Bring her home... I guess.
No more violence... No more violence...
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Here we go again.
He's really cute!
Hi!
Jeeezzz!
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You said you hated him.
You said you hated him.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
MURDERED?!!
MURDERED?!!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! Should she be the next victim?
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it! Someone else might die.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Always the dentist.
You'd probably date him! He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
I certainly did not.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today. We'll see what your teacher has to say.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Is there a killer loose?
Carl's a jerk!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
No comment!
"Serial Mom"? WOW!
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Why?
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Because it's the rules!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
She sure can pick 'em!
Chip, honey?
Thanks, Mom.
Oh God, really! This is the limit!
Let me see!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
But Mom, the video's not over.
But Mom, the video's not over.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies.
Bye, Birdie. Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Oh Mom...
Oh Mom...
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart? PLEEEASE?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Looks good, Mom!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
CHIP!!
God, Mom! What's the matter?
God, Mom! What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
You scared me.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
In here, Mom...
But, Chip...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
This is so silly.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Your mom killed my brother!
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Detectives, what is this about?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Bird books mostly...
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
He goes to college with me!
Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Hi, Hank.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Look at this! "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
That's nice.
That's nice.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Sorry, son. This is a matter for adults.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!

Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly. See the little birdie? Listen to his call. Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Chip, your ride is here.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Goodnight, honey.
Don't I get a kiss?
Don't I get a kiss?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...

Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Amen to that. It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Oh, honey!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
Sorry, ma'am. We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
What a mess.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Yes, I did.
"P" as in...
...People who don't mind their own business.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night... ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
I certainly did.

Did you recognize the voice of the caller?

Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.

Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try... "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.

It's not fair!!
It's not fair!!
Are those pussy-willows?
What did you just say?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
I didn't do it!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up. I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?

One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.

So you admit you just lied?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.

Sorry, Mom. Thanks. Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
And who may I ask is Carl?
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
He killed people, Mom.
We all have bad nights.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
It's him!
No, honey, it's the police. Hello, officers.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Always something isn't it? Can I help you?
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Watch the booth! I'll be back!
0h, that's horrible, honey. I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!

You got your wish.

But... I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Beverly, are you alright?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.
It's the least I could do. I heard shouting.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
That's like your car, Beverly,
I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!

His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.

Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son. Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...

Are we leaving?
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Murder, honey.
Now, here's a babe!
What was that?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?

The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can?
You can?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee

The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.

May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Drink.
Drink.
No.
No.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
Thank you.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Yes.
Yes.

I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.

If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.

I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
What sort of danger?
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
How much does she want?
She could use a hundred dollars.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.

She can only use cash.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?

About forty-five dollars.

For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
But tell me --
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.

I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.

But I like teaching school.

What does she do with herself after business hours?
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
I guess most people are.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Thank you.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
I ought to know.
What is it?
What did she want?
I did her hair.
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?

You fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Yes.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.

Why?
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.

At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.

Weren't you afraid?
Weren't you afraid?
Afraid she might commit suicide? People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was. There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without

Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Good.
Good.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline. ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Thank you.. .goodnight.

The important thing is, the police won't believe you.

I saw him on the floor. He was cut - --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.

I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.

You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.

I'd like that.
I'd like that.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.

What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -

What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.

You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.

Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.

Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.

Who the devil is he?
Who the devil is he?
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
What things? Why?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
We've tried so long to find her.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
Good night.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Gregory  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Gregory  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
Yes.
Yes.
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I know  I shouldn't have told you
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I'm going to find your sister.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.

Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.

You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
Well?
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Well, that's illuminating.
Do you think he knows about this?
I don't know.
I don't know.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.

We could tell him.
Could you find him?
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
What's that?
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
Let her know what?
That you love Mary.
She'll have to know some time.
Not from me.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
No!
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm afraid.
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
Why wait?
Why wait?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.

And then?
And then?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You will die.
Please, Jacqueline.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
I won't get lonely.
You'll be all right?
Yes.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Yes.
Yes.
And you knew he'd be here.
And you knew he'd be here.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have something even better.
I have been at the library.
But you're always at the library.

I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.

I don't know.
I don't know.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.

Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I can imagine.
I can imagine.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --

It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --

Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I have to go -
I have to go -
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --

Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And you believe that?
And you believe that?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.

He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
What's wrong, Mary?
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
They may have been friends of hers.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
I keep telling myself that.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead, Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I understand.
I understand.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others. He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Jason, my pet 
Bella Romari If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata. Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules. When did you say you wanted them?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.

Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Well, since, you're over twenty one
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What a peculiar question.
What a peculiar question.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
But why come to me?
But why come to me?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
She was my patient.
What was she to you?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.

I've lost my knack.
I've lost my knack.
After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet  one as a detective.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet  one as a detective.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
I should like people to read what I've written.
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Wait - there is that other favor.
I'd forgotten.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I think it's time.
I think it's time.
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
Perhaps.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend -- -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Perhaps
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?

It might have.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
I'd like that.
What?
They may have found her. Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Dr. Judd?
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
You know where she is?
You know where she is?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Cloven hoof?
Cloven hoof?
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Would they hurt her?
I don't know.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
One believes - it's like any other religion...

I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.

It seems right to us.
It seems right to us.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?

I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
But you would like to know where she is?
But you would like to know where she is?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Are we? I thought I was very gay.
Are we? I thought I was very gay.
A gay lot - Redi, for instance. I don't know what her sorrow is, but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
I was a great dancer...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...

Unless what?
Unless what?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.

It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
Is it about Jacqueline?
No. She's no longer under my care.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.

I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm very, very serious.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
No, she's with her sister,
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm afraid not.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.

Thank you, my dear.
I'm afraid not.
That's too bad.
Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Why?
Why?
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.

I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
She's not been here for a long time.
She's not been here for a long time.
But she was here?
But she was here?
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
That makes it all the more difficult 

We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever. It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.

Of course.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Yes?
Yes?
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.

I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
She's very beautiful.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Please.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
What did he say?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
No, Nancy. You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Why
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
When?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
But he also wrote --
But he also wrote --
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
It won't hurt.
Ann?
Yes?
Yes?
Graham Dalton.
That was quick.
False alarm.
False alarm.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Do you have other things?
Yes. Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yes. Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Oh.
Have you ever been on television?
Television?
Television?
Yes.
Yes.
No. Why?
No. Why?
Curious.
Graham is an unusual name.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.

Oh, uh-huh.

Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Well...
Well...
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?

No, not really.

Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.

You play an instrument?

No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?

Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
...free-lance. You know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into
Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.

You mean like "time flies"?
You mean like "time flies"?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.

How long has it been since you've seen John?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.

Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Why'd you drop out?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.

That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
This food is excellent.
Thank you.
Mother, father, sister.
Sister older or younger?
Sister older or younger?
Younger.
I don't know.
Who's Elizabeth?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
What's the first?
What's the first?
Lawyers.
Would you mind?
No.
No.
Okay, I will!!
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
How do you mean?
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
I feel like they do.
I feel like they do.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do. I'm getting confused.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
So what about kids?
Kids? What about them?
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Why is that?
Why is that?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Do you want me to?
Do you want me to?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Agreed.
You're what?
Impotent.
Impotent.
You are?
You are?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
Does it bother you?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.

Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?

What?
What?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.

My therapist said that --

You're in therapy?
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
Aren't you?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...

So you don't believe in therapy?
So you don't believe in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.

You had sex with you therapist?

Of course not.
Of course not.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Basically, yes.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
That's correct. Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Hi!

Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Why not?
Why not?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?

Yes.
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.

Does he go down on you?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Is he going to see this?
Absolutely not.
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes.
Yes.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want. I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Yes, I have. I will.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.

Do you want me to stop?
No.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Why?
Why?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!

Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
How come?
How come?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.

How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?

Subtlety?
Subtlety?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.

I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Who? Elizabeth?
Yes.
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?

No.
No.
But you're planning to be?

I don't know. Possibly.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?

Not entirely.

But that was part of it?

Yes.
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?

Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie

As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Don't do that.
Why not?
Why not?
Because.
Because.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?

I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.

I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I don't care.
Come on!!
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Why are you ashamed?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.

You're not answering me.
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I want to know why you are the way you are!
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.

But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works... God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness.
I want to touch you.
No.
Graham...
I'm okay. It's okay.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
You did that?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
John?
Mmmmm...
Mmmmm...
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Yes. I just got busy.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Who'd you have lunch with?
I ate by myself.
Something wrong?
Are you having an affair?
Are you having an affair?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Well, are you?
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
There's nothing to know, Ann.

I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.

My sister, for one. Is that who it is?

For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.

Is that supposed to comfort me?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.

But I'm not.

I'm not either!!
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
Why don't I believe you?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.

Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."

You've made your point.
You've made your point.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Loud.
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.

I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.

I know.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
What?
What?
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
Why?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Where did you go when you left here?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!! Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Yes!
Goddam right.
Yes.
Bastard...
He does.
You son of a bitch!!
Not very often.
I have thought about it, yes.
You bitch. I knew it.
God damn you!!
Yes.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.

Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?

What do you mean?

Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.

What upsets you about that?
What upsets you about that?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.

Yeah, I know.

This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
When did you begin having this feeling?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, yeah. But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.

Did you masturbate?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
God, no.
I take it you've never masturbated?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you

So it was recently that you tried this.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the
Radon leakage?
Radon leakage?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
No, I haven't.
No, I haven't.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you. I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.

Did you confront John about the visitor?

The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of

Is he still at your house?
Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest,
What brought this on?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas. Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?

Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
I hate my sister.
Why?
Why?
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?

Why?

I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why, so you can go after him?

Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
Do you have to say that?
What?
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.

Ann, you always underestimate me.
Ann, you always underestimate me.

Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.

I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?

What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No!

Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck. Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Mr. Millaney?
Yes?
Yes?
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.

Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
He said immediately.
All right, jesus.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.

He'll be really mad.
He'll be really mad.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Hi.
Hi. Want a drink?
Hi. Want a drink?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Was he nice to you?
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Jesus!
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Sure.
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
No, nothing.
You knew these people?
You knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.

So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.

I see. Then what brought you up here?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
He sounded fine.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Medical clinic?
Medical clinic?
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here,
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Do I get a kiss?
Kiss, kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
Another kiss?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
No. Dotty's the last.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
OK. But late.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Where is he now? Do you know?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
But where are you going?
Down to the incinerator.
Can I call you at the office?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
I won't be at the office except to sign in. I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages. I'll come home right after work.
You say something?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Nick, you're so strange...
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK? I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
What happened?
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now. What's your number? The number of your apartment?
We live in 703.
We live in 703.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Yes? Who is there?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Want me to breathe deeply?
Just breathe normally.
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.

Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed. She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan. Must have gone home to mother.

I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Gonna cut me open?

Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did. Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and... ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
You touch my spleen, Rollo. And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.

But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff... ...lookit it!
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Did I say anything?
Did I say anything?
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
It's crazy.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready? Who cares?
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely. All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.

It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.

Who was she?
Who was she?
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me. They used to come here sometimes. Don't ask.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
OK. I'll think about it.
Yes?
That you, Rog?
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
No? How come?
No? How come?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'

I don't get it.
I don't get it.
Lemme clarify for you.
He didn't make it.
Huh?
Huh?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.

I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah. Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing

I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.

I tell you what's cooking. She made the blind see and it was a gift! Who was it from? Let's hear an 'F" for...
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
What?
What?
Nothing. Just...memories!
About Brad's family?
As Janet's parents this should be really easy. Your last clue... Mental Instability. You have thirty seconds.
You got it!
I got it! I got it!!!
I got it! I got it!!!
Congratulations! It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
Infantile regression.
You got it!
You got it!
I got it! I got it!!!
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
He needs help.
I know, I know, it's just...
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I've caught it once or twice.
I've caught it once or twice.
Of course! D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists! That sounds pretty drastic.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Right! An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?

When do I get to see Brad?
After breakfast. You're sounding tense, Janet. Maybe I could give you a little massage?

No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front? What an ideal couple.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Conspiracy? That sounds a little farfetched.
It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.

Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find it...
Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is...

Now Betty, don't overreact.

Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of fact...
Look. Look at that. Bert Schnick can see. Why...he's...dancing.
Yes. Macabre, isn't it. The blind leading the blind.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Care to indulge?
Indulge?
Indulge?
In a little masquerade?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
He was a President.
He was a President.
President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.

I'll leave you young things to it.
Shove it, Ralph!
Shove it, Ralph!
You too, Betty!
Oh, Oliver. What are we going to do?
No! I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
That's us.
I don't want to get up there.

Well I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married. I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. And Hank says Danny's moved to New York. To better himself.
He moved all right! When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.

THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Mr. Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
Sure thing.
Sure thing.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true?

Absolutely correct.

Could you tell us a little about it?

Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.

And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Could I do that later?
Of course.
But they only think they're happy.
That doesn't make sense.
I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad.
The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you.
The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you.
What do you mean?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Who?
Brad! Oh, Brad.
He's a lame dog, remember? But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Oh my poor baby.
Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
I know.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show. The Far East meets the Mid-West!
It's...
It's...
Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
What show?
Poor Brad.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
You shouldn't have said that.
Why?
Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

You're practically naked!

I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
I'm sorry, Officer.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Vance! Vance Parker.
Vance! Vance Parker.
Janet. Janet Majors. It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and... I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Janet. Janet Majors. It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and... I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.

Don't worry, Janet. Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?

No! He's never done that before.
Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Just one or two details. Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
No...couldn't I do this later?
I'm...happy.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Me?
Me?
It's classical. Almost a textbook case...
I want to see Brad.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself. Look at yourself.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous. And Farley's given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.

. . .For his own good.
Of course. He was in great danger of harming himself.
Brad!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog. I've got a lot going for me. I'm going places. I'm going to be someone. I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it. I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.
BRAD!
Arrest that man! He's committed to our care.

Ah. Mr. And Mrs. Majors. How wonderful to see you. I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Our speciality.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
HE!!?? How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Our field.
What does he know about it?
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?
That's an extremely negative response.
Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.

Hi! Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Ah, Macy. Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Ah, Macy. Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Surely.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...

Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?

The fuck was that?
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
It'll just take a second.
It's Christine. Hey you.
You guys having fun?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Good. That's good.
So what's up?
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --

Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.

I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.

And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.

Huh.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Are you there? Miles?
Yeah, I'm here.
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.

You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?

I'm good.
They're from both of us.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.

Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.

They're just leftovers.

Is it chicken?

I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.

You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.

No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great. You both do.
Great. You look great. You both do.
Not so bad yourself.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Me too.
What happened to you guys?
Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi.
Hi. Maya's in the kitchen.
I can explain.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hiya.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Highliner, please.
That's on us.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?

You are not.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
No, we're paying for the wine.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Well, in that case...
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I can't help the traffic.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You said you had it all lined up.
You said you had it all lined up.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah, Conundrum.
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.

I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!

You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Oh, that's tasty.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.

Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.

Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.

Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.

It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.

It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.

No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.

I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

I owe her a call anyway.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Now we're talking.
This is rose, right?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
What color is it supposed to be?
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Huh.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
What do you smell?
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
That's what you do with every one.
When do we get to drink it?
When do we get to drink it?
Now.
How would you rate this one?
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Are you chewing gum?
Want some?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Just a minute!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.

You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?

Whoa.
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

So you're going to stop acting?
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.

If that's what feels right.

It does. Feels right.

Then it's a good thing.

Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Yeah. Tight.
Pour us a couple.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
You know that chick?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.

She is very hot.
She is very hot.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.

So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.

You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.

And she likes Pinot.

Perfect.

Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?

Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?

She works for tips!
She works for tips!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.

I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.

Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.

Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Shut up.
Shut up.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
So what's the plan today?
So what's the plan today?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Nice, huh?
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view. Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.

She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.

Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.

Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.

She what? When?

About a month ago. Six weeks.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
I want to go home now.
I want to go home now.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.

You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!

I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
I'm a quick learner.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Get the trunk.
You have the keys.
We're on.
What?
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.

Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Well, she is cute.
Well, she is cute.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Nah. I want to watch this.
So what should I wear?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.

Aye-aye, captain.

And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.

If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Okay! Fuck!
Pull yourself together, man.
I'm fine!
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --

Count me out.
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Later.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
You should call her.
I will. See ya!
I will. See ya!
Right now.
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
What'd Christine say?
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Yep.
What're you drinking?
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
What?
With this chick.
Does she know about Saturday?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Deep.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Understanding of what?
Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?

Look who's talking. You've been there.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?

This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?

And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.

You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.

You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
That was three years ago after that first party!
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Yeah.
That's a public course. No Stephanie?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy. This is our day!
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Thanks, Jack.
Nice shot.
You're an asshole.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Obsessively.
Huh.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. Here.
What is it?
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Is it the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
With Maya.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.

Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
We're on.
What's happening?

We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?

You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.

Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Put me down, Jack.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
No.
What?

It's private.
It's private.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Let's leave it alone.
You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.

Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.

We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.

Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
I don't have to.
I say we check it out. You never know.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
What's up?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.

You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.

Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.

Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.

Keep it elevated.
Well?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.

Yeah.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Huh. Let me think.
Huh. Let me think.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
What's it look like to you?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You know what I'm thinking?
What's that?
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.

Uh-huh.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
You're joking, right? What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Fucking chick's married.
What?
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.

No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.

Please, Miles, please.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
She tell you she was married?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

Cutting it a little close, don't you think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.

Quite a week.
Want me to drive?
No, I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.

You're so negative.
Come on, let me drive.

I finished it.
I finished it.
Good for you.

The Windmill.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.

Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
She got anything good?

Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.

Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.

She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
You got kids?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, same here.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah. Definitely.
So what's your novel about?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.

So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.

Can I ask you a personal question?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
What about me?
What about me?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.

Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Goodnight, Miles.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.

Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
What rehearsal dinner?
Were you ever going to say anything?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Maya.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
I'm sure he believed every word.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
But you wanted to fuck me first.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you should know
Hello?
Victoria.
Victoria.
Miles?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?

Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Where are you?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Hello?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?

You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
That was big of him.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.

Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?

Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.

Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?

About a year.
About a year.
French or American?
French or American?
Both.

Good stuff.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
So what do you think?
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Exactement!
Should we get dessert?
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
That was fun last night.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Where's Jack?
He had to make a phone call.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Huh.
Huh.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Where?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Stephanie! Stop!
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
It was a surprise, Mom.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
You talked to Wendy?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.

Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Houdini's sick.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
What's the matter?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Only for pee or poop.
Only for pee or poop.
Right.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
It makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
Does she ever answer back?
No.
No.
She doesn't answer me either.
There's dust in it.
This one?
This one?
A hair.

Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed. I'm letting go now.
No dad!
Daddy.
Don't touch him.
I think it's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It tastes funny.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I heard them Morgan.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there... For your children Bo.

I'm scared.
Me too.
Hi sweetie.
Hi baby.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
I don't feel much.
Good.

Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
What? Colleen?... Colleen?
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.

It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...

Clear for what?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Five. The five longest.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.

Just make noises then.

Explain noises.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
No I'm not.
You want him coming in the house next time?
I cursed.
I heard.
It was very dark.
Yes it was.
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That roof is over ten feet high.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
It's noise.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay?
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Morgan, be careful.
I got him.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Yes.
Yes.
How can you say that?
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Do you feel comforted?
Yes.
Yes.
What does it matter then?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Where are you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
They're on the roof.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
This is going to do nothing.
We have to go in the basement.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They're right behind the door.
He was only a year and half old.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
We won't be able to get out of there.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
Merrill --
I'm looking!
Merrill!
Got it!
They're distracting us?
From what?
I can feel air.
Me too.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
They're broadcasting...
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. We won Graham.
How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
How do they know it's over?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. They're leaving. Beat.
No.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother -- -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night. I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
That's good enough for me.
Me too.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Graham.
Don't.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Yes.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
These are D's; I need double A's.
I have some upstairs.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
It's old Morgan.
We might lose the signal.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
I'm getting out now.
Don't do it.
Morgan?
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Bimboo?
Bimboo?
Dad.
Dad.
I just asked his name.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What's two?
What's two?
They win.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
Sounds made up.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we going to sleep?
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
What about Isabelle?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking. How about you Merrill?
Stop crying!
Don't yell at her!
They'll read our minds!
You're scaring your sister.
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Did someone save me?
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Sorry.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
The footprints.
The footprints.
What about them?
What about them?
There are none.
It's not broken.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What was the first thing?
What was the first thing?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.

Sounds like a virus.
Sounds like a virus.
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay. So he was tall?
Okay. So he was tall?
I would say so.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement. But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him
I don't think so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
No.
Is anything missing?
No.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Six months.
And three weeks.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.

It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me.
It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me.
You take care of yourself... Graham.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Is he okay?
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Why not?
Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Pinned? What does that mean?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
It's like War of the Worlds.
It's like War of the Worlds.
They think it might happen all at once.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Don't worry.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
What book!
What book!
They'll find a way in.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue. Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them... ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
No money, eh?
No money, eh?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
What do you mean, the horses?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
All I did was kiss a girl.
That's why they got you in jail?
That's why they got you in jail?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me. So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
...And you had to kill him?
...And you had to kill him?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
You're in here for winging a guy?
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
I think we lost 'em.
There's nobody coming?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Your next water ain't for three days.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
It was my fault.
Emmett.
McKendrick.
I didn't know you were out.
Did it seem short to you?
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
All right then. Let's go.
Forget it.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come
Where were you?
Where were you?
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
...Gotta go...
Sure.
Where are we?
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
That's it.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm sorry.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
You'll never make it.
You'll never make it.
Have to.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
I almost didn't.
Where's Jake?
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
Kate?
She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Gotta go.
Right.
More than enough.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
Paden sends his best.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I just came out to say goodbye.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Goodbye?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
That's why I'm here.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Yeah... that must have been it.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
You must have known that before you came.
It's one thing to know it...
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack. He said he'd... look into it. I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I already did that.
I already did that.
This time you're really going? You know where I'll be.
This time you're really going? You know where I'll be.
That I do.
I've got my people sitting down there... ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Ten A.M.
Ten A.M.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn. So long, kid. I'm sorry.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I'll be long gone.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
You got no idea what they were after?
Offend anybody lately?
Not for five years.
Jefferson City?
No, Leavenworth.
No, Leavenworth.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I had to get up anyway.
I had to get up anyway.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I

We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Where's the pinto going?
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about. 'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. I surely do miss that hat.
I gotta be going.
Going to Turley, was it?
Going to Turley, was it?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
What's Turley like?
It's a town...
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
I expect.
Women?
Women?
I expect.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Which way do you mean?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
He is that.
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
I understand.
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
It's not going to be easy.
It never is. But he's my brother. We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
No hard feelings.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Anybody got any ideas?
Where you been?
Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking. I'll see you around.
I'll be around.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
Yeah?
Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
I'll see you around.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
You might make a farmer yet.
I've got a job.
Daddy?
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
Where is Rae?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.
What happened?
What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Who?
Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.

You own this land.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here. Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.

What about the law?
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
That's a lie.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Never will again.
Never will again.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together. Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
And a pretty lady.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Believe it.
Believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Why?
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that?
What's that?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking. McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.

The other guy drew first.

Right!
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
What now?
What now?
We wait.
Where's your brother?
He'll be here.
This a friend of yours?
He is now.
He is now.
Who is he?
Who is he?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Get out of here, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.

What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
New record.
Let's get out of here.
Kelly, get over here. You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Howdy.
Howdy.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
You wanted to see me?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
You can't do this.
Really?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.

Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?

You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
That ain't right.
That ain't right.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Is that a fact?
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
We'd rather stay.
We'd rather stay.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I was afraid of that.
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Daddy's dead.
He was murdered.
Who did it?
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
It's none of your business.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
Rae, I need help.
Why come to me?
Why come to me?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
What's stopping you?

They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.

What makes you think I could?

Why would they stop you?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
Why him?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Good luck, Mal.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Because they enjoy it.
Because they enjoy it.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
You don't know?
I got there just short of too late.
Lucky.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Where's Emmett now?
He must be pretty good.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
What about his brother?
What about his brother?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Things are getting messy around here. I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I heard that too.
I heard that too.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Cobb.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
I see you're prospering without me.
It's been a while.
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men.
Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men.
I've given that up.
I've given that up.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
You've got a legitimate job.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
You got a place to stay?
I just got to town.
I just got to town.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
What brings you into my saloon?
Luck, I guess.
Luck, I guess.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
I took out thirteen dollars.
This is a lot of money.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
It is that.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
So we understand each other?
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this. They took the little boy, Cobb.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I never could count on you to be reasonable. Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
What's she got to do with it?
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.
Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.
Good-bye, Paden.
You work here?
I run the place. What can I get you?
Nifty.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.

I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --

Stella.
Stella.
Paden.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?

It's the only place I'm happy.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
So-called?
So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.

Here he comes right now.
Is this a fair mix?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
You really are a gambler.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Where's the dog now?
He left me.
What is it that I can't figure?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What makes you say that?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Nah! What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it? Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.

Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I'm ready for that.
How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I've got a place I can hide her.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
That was my plan.
That was my plan.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
I wouldn't worry about that.
I wouldn't worry about that.
I thought you two would get along.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I'm just trying to understand. All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake. This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
That's right. You understand perfectly. I will confess to fraud, not murder.

So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Of course.
Of course.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky? I refer, of course, to Edith.
Who?
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.
It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor? Tell the truth. You'll feel better afterwards.

We all know what happened. In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
We all know what happened. In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No!! I can prove it to you. I'll take you to her.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late. I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go. I owe Viktor everything.

I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.

You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I'm not -- He's not.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Damn -- Yes -- I -- -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship. We could never be anything else. We're just so... different.
Damn -- Yes -- I -- -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship. We could never be anything else. We're just so... different.
Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love. I only make love to the camera.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love. I only make love to the camera.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Christ -- Elaine, I know how it looks but... ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Okay -- for you.
Okay -- for you.
Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
Of course she is. No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
We don't need a name. We'll cast an unknown.
No! You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Excuse us.
God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult. I'm difficult.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.

You're not renewing my contract.
How can I? Your last three pictures tanked. The board is giving me hell. No bankable star will work with you after this. If you just compromised... a little.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I called what's his name at Warner's. He said he'd take a meeting -- in July. I've fought for you Viktor... You want to talk severance?

Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor. If they're good, they get known. And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse. I'm sorry, Viktor.
Where is she?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
Why isn't she with you?
Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
I don't have it on me. Anyway, it means a lot. Have you read the reviews? They're love letters. Listen to this one. "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".

As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine. Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work. She wants all the money up there... ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.

Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife. Second ex-wife. You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful. We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Experience, Viktor. I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them. I'm worried about you, that's all. This woman -- she controls your destiny.

Simone does not control my destiny.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Viktor, I have a feeling. One of my feelings. There's something about her I don't trust.
Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Thank you. What did you think, Lainey?
I got them to remove the reflection. The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
Who else? It's always Simone's idea.
Maybe you're right. Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Better late than never.
Better late than never.
I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
You really think so?
You really think so?
Yes. To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.

Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.
I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
Soon. Soon.
Soon. Soon.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
-- You can't go in there!
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor. If you can't handle her, I will.
Not now. She's emotional. Her mother dies today. Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing". It's not a good time.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
-- I can explain.
-- I can explain.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear. I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She doesn't want pity.
She doesn't want pity.
You're so good to protect her like this.
I'll tell you what. I know how much this means to you. I'll try to get her to plug the film. I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I'll try. Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
She said you were very beautiful.
She said you were very beautiful.
Really?
Really?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I always?
-- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
No.
Are you and Simone... ... getting married?
No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
Thank you.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Do what?
Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.

I do?
I do?
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Excuse me? Start?
Excuse me? Start?
It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.
My two favorite girls.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
... Simone.
She's lying down. She's exhausted.
She's lying down. She's exhausted.
I can imagine.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is it Wednesday? It's Wednesday. How embarrassing. I don't know what I was thinking. With all the excitement lately... Am I interrupting something? Are you expecting company?

When is she coming over?
When is she coming over?
About now. Would you like a drink?
About now. Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Not quite.
Not quite.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.
Impossible.
I just read somewhere --
I just read somewhere --
I know. I know. They'll say anything.
I know. I know. They'll say anything.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards. I should be going, she'll be here soon --
-- She already is. Simone's not coming over, Elaine. Not tonight, not ever. I want you back, Elaine.
I want you back too, Viktor.
This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone. What woman can?
I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.
I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice. It's strange. I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.

No, there isn't. There's nothing to her.
No, there isn't. There's nothing to her.
Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
But you don't understand. She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
But you don't understand. She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
No. She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.

Of course she will. Her public will demand it.
Of course she will. Her public will demand it.
Not if I don't let her.
Not if I don't let her.
You?
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine. Simone is not a real person. I invented her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor. Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone. But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.

-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows? She certainly doesn't need you. Some people even say you're holding her back.

Who says that -- ? -- Never mind. You have to listen to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation. I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --

How much wine have you had?
How much wine have you had?
-- She's a figment of my own imagination. I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.

You're drunker than I thought. Are you doing that again?
You're drunker than I thought. Are you doing that again?
No! Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me! Me! I swear, as God is my judge. You don't know what I've been through. Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me. Why do you think I've been wearing these? I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Thank you! I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.
No... it's life.
Hello?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.
Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.
Well, here I am. You look pretty today. Red suits you.
Well, here I am. You look pretty today. Red suits you.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
It was a great show, Dad...
Let's go, Lainey. There's nothing here.
Just a minute.
God, it's so like your father. Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore? I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence. I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
So you did meet her?
Of course. What are you suggesting?
Of course. What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't. I mean, it feels like I have. I know more about her than members of my own family. She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.
Well, I --
Well, I --
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
Why?
Why?
Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.

Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
Thank God for you, Faith. I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in. You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er... ... scent.
Of course.
Of course.
You look so, so...
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
... so much like her?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.

Simone?
Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again. Do what you do to Simone. I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Yes, yes, again, again. Do what you do to Simone. I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
You're with me to be close to her?
You're with me to be close to her?
Is that a problem?
"Why are we here? Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here? No why. Just here".
Please put your clothes on
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone. Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
Don't I know it. That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
You don't secretly want the attention?
You don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies. How is that healthy for a performer?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real. Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
Who are you really?
Who are you really?
That's a good question. As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
No, I'm okay.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.

What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time. Viktor bought me that time. I owe him so much.
We all do. But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.

And what may I ask brought this on?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Hello, Hal.
Hello, Hal.
The film. The chemistry. No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.

And still the connection was undeniable. I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant. And I know I would be perfect for Clive.

Really? She didn't mention it.
Really? She didn't mention it.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now. She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable. I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
It was more in passing.
It was more in passing.
You're so far off! Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star. Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight. Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction... I'll try to talk her into it.
How will you do our love scenes?
Body double.
Body double.
For her?
For her?
For you. I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale. But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself. She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins. She's on the line now.
Hal, what are you doing?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene! He has to touch her. He has to!

Absolutely not!

I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together. Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago. Let's move on.
Is she here?
I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film. It's very... experimental.
No. In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
Simone!
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God. I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through. I told her it was a matter of life and death. I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
-- Please, get away from me.

I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart. It's important.
I know you'll do it, Dad. You're Viktor Taransky.
Hi, Dad.
Hello, Lainey.
Your mother couldn't make it?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell". But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.

Can't you stop that?
Why?
Why?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world. You can lose yourself. You should get out more. How are you going to meet boys?

Okay. But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
I do.
How?
How?
I read.
I read.
You do? Still? I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.

You were the one who insisted on it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.

Okay, Dad.
If anyone asks about Simone --

Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
One thing bothered me.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
No, not that. I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Precisely.
Good-night, Daddy.
Night, Lainey.
Hey, Lainey. How's your love life?
I do okay. How about you?
I do okay. How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
You know me -- married to my work.
I noticed.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. She broke up with Kent.
Really? Too bad.
Really? Too bad.
She thinks you're with Simone.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out. Dinner, maybe.

Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?

Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.

I'll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?
I'll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
I love you, Lainey.
I love you too, daddy.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did... didn't she?
Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know. Thank her for me.
I know. Thank her for me.
It's from both of us. Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
-- I can't accept it. I don't want a car, Dad.
Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
The old Viktor Taransky. I liked you better before -- before all this. You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity. I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her. And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.

No, that was me.
No, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself. Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you. You deserve better than Simone. I've got to go, Dad.

Lainey...
About you and mom?
Me and Simone. What I did.
Me and Simone. What I did.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy. We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. It's the best deal you're going to get.
I could get the death penalty.
I could get the death penalty.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood. You've killed an icon, for God's sake.

-- No! I can't go along with this horseshit! Just tell them they can fry me!
What?!
What?!
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing! I strangled her! I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire! I did it! I killed her!
Do I know you?

Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols. If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.

They are alive, Sayer.
So they're probably here. You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman? The public has a right to know. Why is she staying out of sight? And why the hell is she with you? I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you? You look kind of "captive" yourself. While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist. Get off my property or I'll call the cops.

The cops? The cops read my column to know who to bust. We're the only watchdog the public has. None of this is going away. We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that. Until you slip up. And you will. You are looking at your shadow. Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not

I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.

Nice try. If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative. I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.

Nice boat, Taransky.
It's a yacht.

I know what you're up to.

I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do. I know it's a fake.
It's bogus. You used an old library shot for the background.
The background is.
The background is.
She was never in New Mexico. She never left the studio.
I've done my homework. I've studied her.
-- I bet you have.
-- I bet you have.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio. Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail. But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts. I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.

Abduction?
Abduction?
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it? What is it -- drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control? All three? What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
I want to see her. Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Er,... good.
What now, Sayer?
Looks familiar, doesn't she? No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
I traced her to a nursing home. A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
She looks a lot like you.
She looks a lot like you.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
That won't be necessary. Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max. You got me.
That won't be necessary. Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max. You got me.
I do? Sure I do. Can we speak off the record? I'm a fair man. I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.

We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
24-hour tail on Taransky?

Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take. But this Simone woman is good.

Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias. She never stays in the same place two nights in a row. Anything on the satellite photos? What about the fingerprints? What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Which means they're significant. Incriminating. Perhaps, criminal. She's hiding her past. She's hiding her past.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure. You know I had something on Mother Teresa. But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore. I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
My God, you've got one?
My God, you've got one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Long live the First Amendment.

Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth. As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.

Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?

Is that why she left you?
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.

It wasn't working anyhow. The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film. I don't think anyone will understand it. I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Yes.
Yes.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Thank you. It's not important.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look. She really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Yes, I'd like that.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said. I mean, you're really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.

But that's Simone's part.

Yes, of course it is. You know you have a line here. Not a wrinkle. Actually, more of a dimple. I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.

You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?

No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Good.
Good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?

She's already here. She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone. Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.

What if it catches on fire?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn. Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Hi.
Perfect. God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Let's take it down a notch.
-- What you don't understand --
Good morning, Simone.

You mean they buy it?
Buy it? They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.

You're right. You're right. Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist. That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake. -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.

Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Not, "Eternity Forever"? The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? I'd kill for that part.

I was hoping you'd say that.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk. It's worth it. Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime? Well, I think we've done enough for today. You've been cooped up in there too long. How about you and me go out on the town? They're expecting us.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.

Are you calling me?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Why, Malcolm?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Why did you leave me?
I didn't leave you.
I just needed to do a couple of things. And I needed to tell you something.
Tell me.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Okay. Fine. Understood. I'm off then.

No, just one.

Next time I won't be scared of you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore.
How do you draw now?

Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Dr. Crowe?
Yes.
Yes.
You believe me, right?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?

Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No, we're not.
No, we're not.
What happened?
You really look better.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...

You have nice red in your cheeks now.

Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Just help.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You believe now?
I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You do?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I guess she did.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Don't go home, okay?
I definitely won't.
I think we said everything we needed to say. Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
Maybe.
You were great in the play, Cole.
Really?
Really?
And you know what else?
And you know what else?
What?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
They're right here.
Oh.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Don't get mad.
Don't get mad.
So who moved it?
There's only two of us. Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer? Is that what happened?
Maybe.
I'd give anything to have been there.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Communicate?
Tell you my secrets.
You know that accident up there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
They did?
A lady. She died.
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
You can see her?
Yes.
Where is she?
Standing next to my window.
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
They?
Dead people.
Dead people.
Dead people?
Dead people?
Ghosts.
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Got it.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
What?
What?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
I know.
She wanted me to tell you--
Cole, please stop.
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
Yes, Cole?
They used to hang people here.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Like what?
Like what?
Stop it!
I don't know how else to look--
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Excuse me?
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
What--
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
How did you--?
Stop looking at me.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Who!

S-ssstop that!

I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
J. C. Penny's?
Good for you.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
How'd he know I'd come?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Meaning?
Meaning?
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?

You're standing in horseshit.
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Alright!
Alright!
Could take a little while, though.

Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.

You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.

No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.

The band.
Aha. The Lovers.
Not lately.
Suzie???
The hell with this. I'm coming back up!!!
Looks like the alternator.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits. Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
How would you know? You're looking at my tits. Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
I didn't do anything --
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Sorry.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
No shit.
No shit.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...

Not someone -- Mac.
Come on --
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Carl, what are you doing?
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Gene.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Sounds familiar.
Sounds familiar.
Book of Jeremiah.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Bus broke down.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
I could. You sucked.
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Hey. Fuck you.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.

All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.

Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
I thought you said two hundred.
Curt Cobain.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Well, there goes our record deal.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
You're out of your mind, man.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Are you crazy?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Manure... is life.
So... what does it do?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Should we be doing this, dude?
Metaphysical question, man.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"-- an AXE!"
"With a hack-hack here --"
"And a slash-slash there --"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Hi Suze.
He means moon shining.
Harvest moonshining!
Harvest moonshining!
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You know who I am. You invited me.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!

Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
How... was she "called?"
Pardon?
Pardon?
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
This is his room... isn't it?
This is his room... isn't it?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.

I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away. Wasn't much right before that, neither.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away. Wasn't much right before that, neither.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
"Blood?"
You'll be back.
I don't think so.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
People say he was a murderer.
That's your grandfather you're talking about! I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
-- It's not me!
-- It's not me!
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
It's time to make amends.
Amends...?
Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.

Throw me one.
Not while you're driving.

I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Never heard of it.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
-- By way of my breasts?
Ow!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Who? Us?!
Who? Us?!
The audience!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.

Down boy.
Down boy.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
He started it.
He started it.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
Amen.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
He's right. You were behind.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Shit!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yes!
Yes!
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
How does it feel, Keith?
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Is that right?
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
Yeah?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Nothing to tell.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
About what?
Name something.
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
What about Jeremiah?
Nah. Just you.
What's wrong?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
So?
So?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Let it go.
Let it go.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
I said that's enough!
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Look. You want to talk about this?
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Mmmm -- so can I...
You wouldn't understand.
You never had trouble communicating before.
Suzie --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --

You're... limping.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
It's you. You and your father.

Suzie --
No Mac, please... I --
Don't look.
Mac... let's get out of here.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Get out of here.
No. Not without you --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I almost thought for a second...
Never.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
What is it?!!
Spider.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Like what?
Like what?
Like your guitar break.
Like your guitar break.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Second verse!
Second verse!
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
-- Where have you two been?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Where's Mac?
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Carl.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Someone better tell Mac.
Why bother?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
What'll we do?
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Shit.
Bill, we need to talk!
Bill, we need to talk!
'Mornin', Jack.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
How are you going to find him?
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
What?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.

And that makes you look like a squid?
And that makes you look like a squid?
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
That's not funny.

Sorry.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Whatcha' doin'?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
What you up to?
Just checking out the lights.
Pretty, ain't they?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Grant, where'd you go?
Hey, Grant.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
No. What ?
No. What ?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
How about Brenda?
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
He tried to kill you, Starla.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Starla, it ain't --
Starla, it ain't --
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
No reception out here.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
That wasn't a good night, no.
I'm sorry.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
What are you doing?!
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
What?
What?
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
No, Starla! No!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
Yeah. Good.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Aspirin.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Okay.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
You took Bill.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
What's she see in that douchebag?
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Where are you?!
We're coming your way, man!
He's a fucking Martian?!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Shelby!
What the hell are we going to do?!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What?
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Rorschach.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.

Megan Halesy' little sister.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.

Where's the old half--Mexican?
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
What?
What?
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Brought you munchies.
Meat.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?

Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
It's just a work thing.
It's just a work thing.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Sure you do.

Out.
I never danced in a towel before.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Welcome home.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
My present?
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.
Okay.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
What are you doing?
You're pretty.
Who's that?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
I'll get if for you.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
What other stuff?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
Through a wound on his stomach?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?

So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Hey, look!
Where'd he go?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent. Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.

You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor. See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.

Mississippi's the other way!
You want to lose this putz or not?!?

Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage. We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
And?
And?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
My very words.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.

He's just exhausted.
That man is your father?!?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things... I know what you're thinking.
What are you thinking?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Bandit.
See ya, Kate.
Why should I?
Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?

You can't swear on these.

Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers. Hear that? Where's his chow?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?

What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.

As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool. Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.

We're outta motion lotion.

I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'll believe it when I see it.
I'm all ears, good buddy.

You're coming up to the scale house.

Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
What's that, pardner?
What's that, pardner?
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.

I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Shut up, Fred.
Who's Fred?

You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Is that Bandit in the lead?

Then it must be a helluva idea.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's the point, Dickey.
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
Now, you just find him, son.
Yes, sir.

-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
That's correct.
That's correct.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?

Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
-- so you shut them off?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
What kind of personnel?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
You have a butler working that floor?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Is your security team armed?

Of course. Yes.
Of course. Yes.
And who has access to that floor?
Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.

I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
And a very bad gamble.
And a very bad gamble.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
No rest for the wicked. Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this? Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny -- -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.

What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level. Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Get a coroner's estimate too. -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Maroon uniforms?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
No. I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
How bad?
Mortal.

Who?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
You're sure?
You're sure?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.

Ww... uh...
Ww... uh...
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.

I did. We -- yeah, I know.

I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Really?
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Man, that's great.

Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
That's not possible. I told you.
That's not possible. I told you.

-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I'm here, where's the car?
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
What happened?
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours
So I guess you're not going.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Yeah, we've been through that.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.

-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I? Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Your attitude sucks.
Your attitude sucks.
I been accused of worse. What do we got...?
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks. There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
Then what --
D'you talk to'm?
I got his machine.
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
I left him a message.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Okay.
Okay.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
About what?
Look at the collar on that coat...
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz... And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket. So y'got semen, human ejaculate -- -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now?
I could have it sent out...
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out. Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update. Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed. ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are
That's probably him now...
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life. So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out. You'll walk with me.
FUCK YOU!
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want! Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --

-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
They what? What? No. No. Why?
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
I thought Heller was a double op?
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
It's the last place they'd look.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and
Here. Sit. Please.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Difficult to explain everything now... And much larger issues loom. I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
Where's Israel?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
You're finished.
And you just figured that out? The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...Does he know?
...He does now...
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
...When did you know all this?
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...Are you insane?
...Almost. What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...holy shit... that's Heller... Isn't it?
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...So you made another deal?
...So you made another deal?
I wouldn't go that far.
I wouldn't go that far.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead. Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.

...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us... The way they betrayed him...
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us... The way they betrayed him...
I don't see it like that at all.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
No... It's not. What it lacks... is an end.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
I'm here.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --

So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back,
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
... Jesus... what for?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Wow.

Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.

What are we talkin' on the split...
Why?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.

What's the time frame?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Gibarian.
Leave the light off.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her. Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You're being tricked. Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors. He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field. Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.

Can it work?

It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone. Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
I can trust Rheya.

A puppet.

And you're not? Maybe you're my puppet. But like all puppets, you think you're actually human. It's The Puppet's Dream. Wondering if they're human!
You have to give me your word you won't come in. Then I'll come out.
All right.
What happened to Gibarian?
Didn't you talk to Snow?

I want to hear your version.

Who, here, could possibly care what you want? At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction. They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?

We're done. Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow. There's something wrong with him.
No. There's no behavior modification.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Yes.
Yes.
That's fantastic.
That's fantastic.
Why did you agree to come here?
You killed her!
Not her. It.
You murdered her!
Kelvin, she begged me. I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters. She walked into it and disappeared. She was gone.
She'll come back.
No, she won't.
No, she won't.
Why would you let her to do that?
Why would you let her to do that?
It's not human, Kelvin. Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that. Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win. I want humans to win. So I am killing it before it kills me.

Whose side are you on?
It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight.
How quickly?
How quickly?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
Where's Snow? Did you call him?
Yes.
What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian?
He's dead.
He's dead.
How?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
What?
What?
I love chocolate. I realized just yesterday how much I love it. I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
I can't talk just now. I'm too tired.
Where's Sartorius?

In his lab. He won't let you in.

I'm not sure. It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. He covered the video lens.

That's ludicrous. This is contact. We have found God. The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth. So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Kelvin, you awake?
What is it?

Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
