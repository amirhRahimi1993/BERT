You didn't?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
I haven't won it yet. I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
An hour after...! Deak, for Heaven's sake! Let's give her a night in New York City. We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
LaPlante! That asshole! I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
We're from Channel Four, yes. We'd like to find --

We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home. Know why? 'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him. I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends. Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin
No dead body. Too bad. Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
There's no face really, nothing to work with. Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Look at the guy! He just saved fifty people. Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous?
He's pretty... remarkable.
He's pretty... remarkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?

Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you. From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton. He wants you to call him.
What about?
What about?
I didn't ask him.
I didn't ask him.
Call him back. Ask him. I'm a little...busy.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley. That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...

Nobody stole my credit cards. They burned up in the crash. Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
You test each one thoroughly?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests. You want consistency? You want dependability? You want safety?

Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>. I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle... ... then look out.
Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend.
How are they with kids?

They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding.

So this really does the trick, eh?

Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle. And God help whoever it is. Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground. Put your faith in that, pal.
So, <u>Neil</u>. How's it goin'?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm Bernard, by the way. Those are cool Reeboks, Neil. They're real new, aren't they?
Hey, c'mon.
They're really white.

All right then. That's important, isn't it? -- For you to be in an "up" environment. I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.

Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.

When I was a child... I got used to the closets. The boxes. The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip. I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood. Cardboard. I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard. That smelled like rust and decay. It was safe in the boxes. It
I guess so. I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone. I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone. In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best. I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Oh, fine. She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.

The whole disapproval thing. If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you? -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.

Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.

Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.

Mommy!
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
You've done a really great job with the house. It's great!
Yeah. There's still a lot I want to do. It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here. Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.

We're going to think about it.

There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Fuck you, Philip.
I thought we'd be happy here.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us. You'll see.
The cab's waiting!
Where should I hide the car keys?

I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

Did you lock the garage door?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Yeah -- she did a good job. This glass looks brand-new.
The floor has a nice shine to it. Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Did she water this plant? It looks a little bent out of shape.
He wants to see me!
Philip! The senior partner?

His secretary just confirmed.

C'mon.
Honey? How did it go? You didn't call me.
He wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
What?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes. When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled. I had cancelled! Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Oh, honey.
Oh, honey.
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u>
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
There might be some extras in the garage.
Honey, it's not the end of the world. You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up. And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own. You are free now, you are independent.
I'm <u>fired</u>. I'm unemployed. Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength? Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!

You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!

This is my house.
Oh God.
Yeah -- we know him. He's been hanging around the house.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
We'll talk in the morning.

I didn't.

All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.

What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog. What does EVERYONE want me to do? You want to move back? Huh? Would you like that? Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Hiya, sport. Where'd you come from, huh?
Can we keep him?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
You knew a second ago. <u>Who</u> started it?
-- A man.
Do you see a man?
No.
No.
No man! <u>Go to your room</u>.

If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?

Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
You didn't see this. Understand?
Yes.
Did you find a sword? An old sword?
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
What is it?
What is it?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning.

The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
That's not all, Lieutenant. Wait until you see the tape. It's unbelievable.
I'd like you to see this.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset. We're stepping on their toes of this one.

I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank. Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
So?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.

You don't understand. About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey. A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley. The fourth body we've never been able to identify. All four men died from decapitation. Nash was our primary suspect

It's circumstantial.
For Chrissake! Gimme a break. The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view. There's something missing here. It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career. It's called evidence. Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. Find me an eye witness. Dig up a motive. Until then we don't have a case against
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
When did you get back?
A few days ago.
A few days ago.
That's what I figured. Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you. I took a walk.
I already told you. I took a walk.
Tell me again. Where'd you go?

And Brenda?
She was a good woman.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.

No.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.
No.
You sure?
You sure?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash. That's a promise.
Is that it?
No. I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Get outta here.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
No -- it isn't. A cop died today and the other is barely holding on. I want some answers, Nash.

I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.

That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on. You're connected to this guy somehow. He's after you -- just like the others were.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on. You're connected to this guy somehow. He's after you -- just like the others were.
It's late.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords. One cut off the others head. He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Most people are afraid of death.
Yes -- I think it is.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.

The prize? So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again. So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children. The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.

Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change. Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon. They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.

I hear you.
I hear you.
What else? What else do you hear right now?
The river.
That's all?
That's all?
Yes.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees? The songs of the birds. The horses breath? There is a whole world around you. Alive. Living. Feel it -- become part of it. Live your life, Highlander. It's going to be a long one.
That is what bothers me.

What worries you?

You.
You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart. Would you live that pain again?
No. What am I to do?
No. What am I to do?
The only thing you can do. You must end it.
Well?
It's done.
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
No -- I will.

She'll soon be of age.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
This cannot be.
It is. Do not ask me how. I do not know. I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.

Let me ask you something else. At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed. The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section. What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
So?
So?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them. They would have had much more strength pushing on them.

If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.

Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
--for three hundred years.

How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.

Not unless they're immortal.
Would you like to see it?
I've seen it.
I've seen it.
On the back it has--

--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
How did you know that?
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried. The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
You?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
And the other one -- he is like you?
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me. We are the last of our kind. The last of the Calans. I do not know what purpose we were put here for. I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?

He will not stop until it is over.
He's in there!
Get out.
Be careful, Conner.
Conner?
What now?
Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Sounds very -- normal.
Just a little. Who knows what we're going to find in there. It could be a huge excavation. A little friendly PR never hurt.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?

They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning. This could be a very important find. I want it documented.
We're holding the workers down below.
Why?
Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
What? How?
He's fine. He swears he never left his post for a moment. He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
How could they get by him?
How could they get by him?
I don't know.
We found him this morning.
What's that next to him?
What's that next to him?
His head. Someone cut it off.
Incredible. The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds. It's a remarkable duplication.
I don't think it is a duplication.
I don't think it is a duplication.
It has to be.

And this?
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.

I know, Paul.
Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I like my work.
I like my work.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
We'll see.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
Impressive -- is it not? The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes. I need more power to hold the form longer. I need the Highlander. Where is he?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I know. I know-- you would not tell me. Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me. Oh well -- I shall find him. Time is on my side.
Oh -- I almost forgot. Your head.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
This cannot be.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
That's what the Kurgan said.
That's what the Kurgan said.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries. I can wait a little longer.
Why did you wait?
Why did you wait?
It was not by choice. A small matter of a mountain falling down on us. We were trapped inside. When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands. What you thought was the end -- was not. This is the end. We are the last of our kind, Macleod.

It will not end tonight.
You cannot hide from me. You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want. Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want. The world will be mine.
You know it's not safe here for you.
I know.
I know.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.

It isn't over, is it, Conner?
No.
No.
How can that be?
How can that be?
I don't know.
Is there anything else you need?
No -- I'm fine. Thank you.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Me too.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Don't leave us, Conner.
It's not for me to decide.
Don't cry, wee one. It's a better place I go to.
I love you, Conner.

Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.

What are you doing?
I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake.

I heard voices downstairs. Is everything alright?
Fine.
Fine.
What will you do?
What will you do?
There's nothing I can do. I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Why?

You also have a power, Conner. It is why you have survived.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart. Your dreams live there.
My dreams died long ago.

Did they? You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man. You feel the same -- want the same. You want to live.

Dear, sweet, Rachel. Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done. Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just. This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made. And now, it is for you to
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.

I think he's dead!

Don't shout, Larry. I'm three feet away.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith. They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant. When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Yes, sir.
Wow. Sure, right away, Chief.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry?

You get anything on Smith?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Keep trying.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it. I would've moved in when we first found out.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Yes, sir. But what about the disks? If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.

I want a message sent: No fuckups allowed.

I'll make the call.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath. The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You should warn them, Sonny.
<u>Fuck</u> them! Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Put our people on the scene. Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
He knows better than that.
He knows better than that.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family. Who's running the show up there?
Find out how we can hurt him. By the end of the day, I want to own him.
It's happening right now.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic. It's three kids. They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that. Why would they search the house?
You think we should take that chance?
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
I guess not.
I guess not, too. How much information is in the house?
What, he's cute? That's his idea of humor?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too. You should let them know.

No way. I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
Jen? Are you all right?
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Who sent you?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine. I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

Shut up, goddamnit! Just calm down!

We're on foot. We can't get away.
We're on foot. We can't get away.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.

You're being stupid. Check out the bathroom. Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus. What is this?
Are you totally stupid? What does it look like?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Jesus, first Mars, now you. You two need anti-depressants.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith. What if he wakes up?
That's why we tied him, dumbass. Now come here and see this --
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard. All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
That's crazy, Dennis. The cops will see us.

If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. He's probably planning it right now.

The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed. There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Hey, Dennis? Can I let you in on a personal secret?

You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?

Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We're rich.
Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We're rich.
We're trapped in a house.
We can take it with us.

The high command? Our high command?
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. I thought I'd better tell you.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
The police are very busy.
The police are very busy.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
He did.
Well rewarded Those were his words.

I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
I am going to do you a great favor. I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
We are better here.
Listen, you need me.
You are a marked man.
How so.

Business is good at the hotel?

Very good.

Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Please, except my humblest apologies...

Good for you. We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...

I would never do that.
I would never do that.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.

I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
That will take time.
That will take time.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.

One thousand francs.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
I need a great favor.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I will see what I can do.
Was there blood?
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.

They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
You could have asked for a favor.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They do not have your connections.
They do not have your connections.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Jean Baptiste!
The president has been murdered.
Murdered! By whom?
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
I sent them home. Go and call them.

They know you are Tutsi!
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Dawn. Then they go.
Oh, my God!
Where are you hurt, son?
What is it, Paul.
Stay with the children.
Paul, don't let them die.
Get in.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.

He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Give him time.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
They are being evacuated.
What about us?
What about us?
We have been abandoned.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
But who is left?
But who is left?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
You could leave, Paul.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Go to the roof now.
What for Paul.
What for Paul.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
What's the matter?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
I have to go out to get food.
Go out! Where?

You cannot go alone.
You cannot go alone.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
A kiss.
I have a confession. When we met...
In Ruhengeri?
In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

Please, please try one more time.
Please, please try one more time.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
A little longer, Paul?
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No.
I have to stay.
No! Sit down now.

I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Let me go. Children get off.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of water.
We are almost out of everything.
We have to have a plan.
What sort of plan?

Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.

Please do not talk like this.
Please do not talk like this.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Oh, my babies.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Can I have your name again?
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
There is one thing I need right away.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Why?
Why?
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
Rutaganda's place?
What's wrong?

Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.

Many times.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.

Twelve are dead.
How dead?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
What do we do with all these people?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
What are you doing?
The lieutenant wants the register.
Where has all our beer gone?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.

I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
When?
When?
As the trucks go.
What is this about no water?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Paul. Are you alright?
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Out? Where are you going?

All. What do you mean all?

Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.

How much more do they need than your death at his hands?

And how the hell are we going to do that?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Not at all!
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
I'm moved beyond words.
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
Looks like we're it.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Oh, for chrissake --
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Yeah...something.
More the merrier.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
C'mon.
What are you playing here, Price?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
You're not my list.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
-- I'm sure you did.
There must be some other way out.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together. Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Melissa!
Ms. Marr!
What?
Is she alright?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Three times, to be exact.
Three times, to be exact.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Where is it??
I don't know!!
I'm sorry --
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
-- what was he doing here?
-- what was he doing here?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Oh, really: who?
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
As a tumor.
This thing's going nowhere.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
-- fuck you!
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Yeah, me too.
-- I did: down here.
And I think that's case --
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
'Less the place really is haunted.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
You said that was an accident.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.

-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --

What's in there?
Nothing.
What is it? What's in there?
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Did it work?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Left, goddamnit!
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Yes.
What's down there?
The...Fourth of July.
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.

Oh. Jesus.
Poor Mr. Price --
Uhhhh...
What?
What?
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
It's not going to let us out!
If you know where it is, get there!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Pritchett, is that you?
Up here --
Pritchett!
Over here!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And we get this money when?
And we get this money when?
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
This is nuts.
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
I'll meet you down there.
Take the gun.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Best of a nightmare.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Prove it.
Prove it.
Prove it how?
Oh, Jesus....
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- the stained glass --
-- yeah, we did that --
-- closed.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Is she...alright?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
I'm better than that.
I'm better than that.
Don't push it.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why?
Why?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Thanks.
Most fun I've had all day.

Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
No...not air --
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.

I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- you lose either way, Price --
-- listen to the man --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Back where?
Good point.
Let's try down here...
What are you looking for?
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Cheery looking bunch.
Better living through electricity.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Or an on-line computer.
That's crazy!
That's crazy!
What about that other guy?
This is the best we're gonna do.
It'll have to do.
Price!!
He's gotta still be down here.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
He's dead...?
Don't think it's even an issue.
We're safe?
What --
-- was that??
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
For chrissake give me a hand!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
It's succeeding!
It's succeeding!
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Where did it go?
Run.
Run.
What --
You okay?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I don't do groups.
What?
Jesus!
...Jesus H. Christ.
So where's the party?
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
You've got your own TV show?
You've got your own TV show?
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I hope not.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Don't touch me!
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.

Haven't they already?
Could we have a word?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.

It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?

I know.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.

Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94. Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
Asking the wrong person again.

Funky little house, ain't it? Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head.

Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
First time for everything.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Do something!
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Please! Something! Oh-God!
Maybe if I --
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I can't remember at the moment.
I'm ready now.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.

Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive! And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
I think...I may have the answer.
What?
What?
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
House 2, Guests 0.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Vannacutt!!
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
I am.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.

Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
What is it??
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- the window and door grates --
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
I was upstairs!
I never saw you --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?

Please! I need your help.

Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Problem where? Looked good to me.

But the million bucks each, that's for real?
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
Of course he did, for God's sake. Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
I can't comment until I get paid.
Oh, no.
What's going on?
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Won't do any good.
Why not?
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Believe me, we need to.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?

No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.

You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Ghosts killed your father?
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...

And you think it's in there?
And you think it's in there?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
There is something very not normal going on here!
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then... ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...

Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?

You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Blackburn's dead.
Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
He would have been back by now.
Price!
Oh, dear.
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!

I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there...
You say you saw some activity here?
Damn it.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
These records only go back to 1880. But... ...wait a minute...
Did you find something?
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster. They had a daughter. Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
It doesn't say. But that's not what interests me. There's no death certificate for the daughter. Anywhere.
What was her name?
What was her name?
Colleen.
So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her?
It might have been her mother.
It might have been her mother.
We don't have proof of that.
We don't have proof of that.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself. Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
They don't build them like this anymore.
Suppose not.
Town records are coming up now.
What will they tell you?
What will they tell you?
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously. And who died here.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
No, I live about in Wexford. It's about a five hour drive.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university. I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.

Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Yes. It was.
It looks delicious...
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Did you find her?!
No!
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
That poor little girl.
Where does this amulet come from?
It's origin is unknown. The symbol does correspond to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
By killing them?
By killing them?
By freeing them.
By freeing them.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
What do these ingredients mean?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Sure.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Well I bet you they're happy.
Can I do it again tonight?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
Maybe it was Colleen...
Who...is Colleen?
It's going to hurt us!
No it won't - no it won't!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Yes.
Can you talk to her?
She talks to me.
She's down...
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Ok...
My angel!
I'm scared!
Are we leaving mommy?
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
H-how long will it take?
Go to your room! Now!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
What do you mean? Mommy? You're scaring me!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
I'm ok mommy.
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
Where is she?
She's here.
She's here.
Where is she now?
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
She's down. Help her...
Take me to her.
Help me! Please!!!
My God, I heard something!
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure. Did you see the others?
Sure. Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
I want this one, daddy.
Ok. If you want this room, you can have it.
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
He's blessing the house.
Why?
Why?
For good luck honey.
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Look daddy! It's empty!
That's great, honey.
We're here Aubrey! Look, don't be afraid. We want you to come back to us...
It's dark! I can't breathe!
I can't move!
Fight it back Aubrey. Fight it back as hard as you can!
Mommy please help me!
Don't be afraid!
Don't be afraid!
Daddy, please!!!
Oh my God! She's in there!
Daddy help!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Well, that all depends.
Good night Angel...
Good night daddy.
Mommy!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.

What's the matter?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...
Oh come on...
I just, I don't know...
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
What will Aubrey think?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it. She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
You didn't think much about that before.
You didn't think much about that before.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura. It's over. You know that.
It's just going to take a while.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Or what she was worth.
God rest her soul.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment. She didn't even know who I was. It's just... tradition.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What?
What?
It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you.
What the hell is that?
I don't know. That's strange.
No. Maybe it was Aubrey.
She's asleep. I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
She's asleep. I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly. I just want to...
...set up some more things.
Ok.
The heater's here.
Were you fooling with the power?
Were you fooling with the power?
No.
No.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on? I just had a bulb break on me!
What is it?
It was in the cellar. Weird.
It was in the cellar. Weird.
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off. The videotape...
So what are you saying?
So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it.
Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it.
Who?
Who?
I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
Oh come on!
What about keeping an open mind?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Voodoo stick? It's nothing like that Will. You're just being cynical.
Voodoo stick? It's nothing like that Will. You're just being cynical.
I'm being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should count for something.
It just disappeared. Literally.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Whoa there...
Are you ok?
What are you talking about?
She has a...friend. Colleen.
She has a...friend. Colleen.
A friend?
A friend?
You, an imaginary friend. That's what she calls her.
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
I think everything's ready.
Good. I'll start bringing things in.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
She's gone!
Aubrey?! Aubrey?!
Aubrey!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me. What do you mean by that?
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I'm fine.
Ok...
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we? You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Should I...
Should I...
No. You two are the most important things in my life. I don't ever want to lose you.
You don't think I know?
Know what?
Do you think I'm a fool?
What?
What?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What are you talking about?
Maura, what is this!
We're not going.
We're not going.
Not going! Are you out of your mind?! Wait!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
No... NO!
Maura!
What's happening!
Are you all right?
I'm ok.
You're bleeding.
I'm all right...
Not at all. I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We don't know.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
I think we should do it.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
What about the other five percent?
Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information.
She's at school. We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Ok, so we have a...presence. What do we do about it?
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Before.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
Maura.
Maura.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
White meat will be fine...
You must be a Londrigan.
Yes, I am.
...at her request. She was a very religious woman.
Oh, that's nice...
Oh, that's nice...
May I come in?
Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it.
Did you know her very well?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
It was a shame.
It was a shame.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here. She would call me, and I would come by.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Your daughter's been taken.
What!
I'm going to need some blood. It must be from a woman.
Why?
Why?
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
So what should we do, father?
Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you.
Aubrey? It's mommy.
Concentrate! She can hear you!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
She's coming back. Keep talking!
Come back to us honey!
You must be the new tenants.
And you...are?
My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church.
How can I help you?
What was she afraid of?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things...
Did you have dinner, father? We have plenty.
Well thank you for the offer, But I really have to go.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Well there's no time like the present. Good night.
Good night.
We'll never know for sure.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over. And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
This isn't happening...
The amulet...
What...amulet?
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've been here before to cast evil from this house. The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals. It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she!
So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
What are you getting at!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there. It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
How long will it take!
It will not take long...
Keep talking!
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey. Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
The rain is letting up.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
What's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Take care of the girl. Take care of your family. They are important.
Yes, they are.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
We'll be there.
No. But I'm a clairvoyant. I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Oh.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend. A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds. That would include myself and an assistant.
And what would you do?
And what would you do?
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here. Maybe some kind of a rodent.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Not really. Oh, wait a minute.
Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Runic?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
Not at all, if it can help.
There's something in there.
What?
What?
There's something through that wall!
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
Well what is it!
I don't know! Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
What do you mean?
I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
What, you think I'm kidding? I guarantee it. An inch more flank. Boys upstairs get hot. Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Jesus Christ ...
C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories.
Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories.
Right. Like last night's doozie.
Right. Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
I know what I saw.
And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story.
Not on station time.
No. Not on station time. My story. My time.
I know. I know. But it's just so ... neat, isn't it? The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery. But that's all it is. Mystery. Not malice. What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter.
Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place.
Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place.

Doc? ... Doc ... Hello?
Wait ... wait. You ... you have to help me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming this?

You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you're not dreaming. Do you know where we are?
It's ... I don't know. First World War, right?
It's ... I don't know. First World War, right?
Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Well done. Brave girl. You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What the Hell is going on?
Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What the Hell is going on?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey. And we have to stop it. I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true. Will you walk with me a while?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently. This is me a few years later. We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921. I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see. So many dead. For us God, too, fell at Flanders. We adjusted to the
And what is ... this frozen moment?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
The cusp of my life. What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision. I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.

And what did you discover?
Something bad.
And why are you back? Why are we here?
Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That's no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. Unstoppable.

What will he do? What does he want?
What will he do? What does he want?
He'll do what he does best. But he'll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.

What can we do?
I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
I don't know ...
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another. You're stronger than you think.
Then tell me what to do.
Then tell me what to do.
This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy it.

So where is it?
So where is it?
Your apartment.
Wha .... ?
The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.
It was off the statue. In the club.
What happened to him?
Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.
It's nothing to do with me. I wasn't even with him.
Look, lady! I told you! It's not my problem! I was just there!
Where?
Under The Underground. Can I like GO now?!
Under the Underground? What's that? Where is ...
Uh-huh?
Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Joey. Yeah, who is this?
You like ... left me a card? At the club?
Right. Right!

I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah. Yeah. Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right? I'll trade you. You give me couch-space. I'll give you talk. OK?
Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?
Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway.
I put some decaf on. Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Right.

Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh yeah ...

Why are you so interested?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.

No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out.

That's great.
That's great.

No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. It's just I don't dream. Never have. ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams. I'm jealous. It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?

I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them.
Great. Thanks. You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.
I'm trying to quit.
Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental.
It's okay. It's just someone burned me once.
Oh. You wanna talk about that stuff.
Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was.

But I don't know anything! Really. I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. He ...
Did you know him?
Did you know him?
No. I'd seen him in there a few times before. He was just a punk. I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue.

Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?
Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?

I figured I'd make breakfast.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory?
Ha! I don't know yet. First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
I'll boil some water.
I'll do it!
I'll do it!
No! No, that's OK. I like to. I love boiling water. It's a specialty of mine. Why don't you go watch cartoons?
This is great. And it's yours? You like own it?
The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.
The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.
Jeez, I've never owned anything. I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
How have you ... ?
Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys.
Wow. Lotta books. You read all these?
No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.
No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.
Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that?
Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that?
I don't think so. But it's a fascinating subject. Did you ...
... but it is good. You know, over to the left, you can ...
Who's that?
I don't know his name ... I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the
And he still sits there?
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
But I don't know what's going on.
Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ...

I was downtown looking for a ... a friend. A guy I know. Anyway, there was this store. Like real old? Lotsa weird shit in there. I saw this statue. Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Would you know this store again?
Would you know this store again?
Sure. Why?

It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping.
Jesus. Are you sure this is the street?
Yeah. Happening, isn't it?

Buying some drugs, alright?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Oh, Terri ...
For somebody else, alright? Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Here! Here! Pull over!
What am I looking for?
God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.
Joey ... ?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.
No. Sorry. Not interested. Not for my customers. Have you tried ...
No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ...

I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business. I ...
Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made the store feel strange. Who'd make such a thing?
Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?

Oh come on. There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
... Let it define you. Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
No. Really?
Yes really.
Wow. Thank you.
Wow. Thank you.
No. Thank you.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Unh-unh.
It doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested.
Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person.
But you gave me a rose ...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out.

You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard! You get me in here ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard! You get me in here ...
Right. Like you were hog-tied or something.
What ... What ... ?
What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl?

Yes.
Yes.
Good. So did I. And that's all ...
Good. So did I. And that's all ...
No! No. It's not the same ... I ... No. What you did ... it was ... evil.
I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do?
Fuck you!
Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse...
What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
Because you want to. You've always wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look at your sculptures. Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as canvas. The body as clay. Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
A dark star rising. I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed. A friend relieved me of that inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born again of Blood and Desire.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
But how in God's name ...
But how in God's name ...
God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
How do we start?
It has already begun.

Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I'd like to put things right. Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ...
Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ...
I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you.
I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you.

Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
Oh, I don't ...
Oh, I don't ...
C'mon. It'll be great.
Not quite. This wasn't here.
No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.

A girl? Anyone I should know?
A girl? Anyone I should know?
Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah right. Look ...
Terri, listen. Why don't you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? Let's get it out of the way. See how we feel. Then we can relax. Talk. You know.
I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet.
Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
That's terrible. What a bitch. She was obviously just using you, Terri. Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again.
No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this.
Really?
Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
It was so beautiful! When the blanks went off, they...
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Something like that.

Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
That was beautiful.
I laughed, I cried.
The security's actually not that severe.
It doesn't have to be. Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Delivery Entrance. Low Security.
Gum.
Eighth room down, babe...
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom. Sorry I was late. Miss anything?

So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam. Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
I didn't know how to tell you. A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night. Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month." Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
I read about these people in Newsweek. Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe? Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph? Captain Bob's steering wheel?

Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino. I gotta go be a boss.
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Sure. That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmmm.....
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
The safe's a Simpson 71. Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.

Don't wet your diapers. I'll have to change them. "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Cameras?
No need. Guards' station's right there.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
You got about five minutes and change.
5:32. "Swinging on a Star."
5:32. "Swinging on a Star."
You know they invented something while you were inside. Called a watch.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"He can't write his name or read a book. To fool people is his only thought."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
"Every day you meet quite a few."
The song's over! Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
What am I doing here? There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this. Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.

Did I miss anything?
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
The Butler did it. Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head. He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian. Horse things.
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Morning edition. Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.

"Attempted." At-tempt-ted! I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride. Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
Boing. Uh, this I don t understand...
Why try?
Why try?
Because I'm tired of not understanding things. Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.

Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
But I said I was sorry....
But I said I was sorry....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life. What was your per-diem?
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life. What was your per-diem?
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins? I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Rio, Alex? After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Damn travel agency. That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
We're going in from the ground floor.
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain. All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
You sound disappointed.
You sound disappointed.
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
Count of three?
Why not just go now?
Why not just go now?
Okay.
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Now that's a lock.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
That was close....
Anna, I think you better stay....
Anna, I think you better stay....
You can be lookout!..... Take Alex's gun.
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
"But we'll be the same as we started...
I'm a ghost. Boo.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Alex, are you....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight. I lost ten pounds in Rome
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight. I lost ten pounds in Rome
You're a reed, man. I gotta get Anna. Hang in there...
Get 'em. They went down the hallway.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Get em....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Too-do-loo, babe.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Yes way.
My life is not some deal. I...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Welcome back to Vinci.
Last rites, sister?
How.
You're unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her plan is over.
You're unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her plan is over.
My plan is just beginning. I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!

Don't you just hate kids...

I call them the MTV.I.A. Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date. No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers. I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff. It'll have the least number of guards....
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries. This is France, you gotta have French.....
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Italy, France, Moscow. They all just wanna be Nebraska. Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do. Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job. If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....

Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
This is the room above the Art Treasures room. The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
What the hell....
You're supposed to be dead!
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
No, your Eminence. I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.

Attempt, you mean. The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk. The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists. We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey. Must you flirt with him so realistically?

A little petting is not the issue!
A little petting is not the issue!
Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything? What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?

I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.

Excuse me, Milady. I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Tough guy. What are you--How's your head.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
That's what you theenk.

Question, sir? His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out. Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Never, why do you ask?
Whoa. Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Sure Hudson. Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?

Oh. No.
It's not what you think. Okay, maybe it is....
You really went and did it. With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it. Nobody does it better, Hudson. You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.

Wha--
Wha--
What are your plans for the weekend? Hoisting away the Colosseum? Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces. Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Does everyone in the world know more than me? Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half. Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!

Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Hudson, don't you understand...
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman. I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.

It's from the machine. All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already. We can't let that happen.

Wha.....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down. Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Wha -- you don't want to know...
I wanna know...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.

Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God. But you're a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God. But you're a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?

Way to go, Anna.

When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.

Anna. Anna. Anna. If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep. Kit Kat...
Cat got his tongue?
Actually he never told us what it was.
How many times do I have to say it? I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp. I actually found him, "endearing."
Sure. Face down. Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man. What did Little Eddie ever do to...
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House. Easy as my brother's wife. Directions are in the bag. Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Hawk, you're a great thief. Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of. Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass. But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Baseball, why?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila. Veto, Darwin.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe. I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones. But now finally I got my new goal. World domination. With your help...Bunny....quit that!

Bunny, ball-ball! Bad bunny!
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven? You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Like a "cat", one could say.
No, let me!
I don't care.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou. In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Alchemy! Is the business term of the 90's, my man! Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago. I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history. Money isn't everything, gold
Market crashes. Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects. We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world. In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower. It's one party we'd love to poop.

Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority. Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
We're here to say, your government was right.
We're here to say, your government was right.
So let's get busy. Have some fun and make some deals.
I knew it! I told you it was a fake.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?

For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide! Alfred, hold my calls. So, Hawk! The Hawkster! What do you think of the vehicle?
You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Whatever. You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads. You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right. I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is. Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse? What am I saying, you did buy it...

Oh... Let's see. There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand. We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.

I guess that's a no.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career! I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
You want an address on that last one?
What a pleasant surprise. You're probably wondering...
But you're going to tell us anyway...
Have a seat. Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
What job?
The auction house, asshole. One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been. No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free. I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes. You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me! I did dog and pony for you! You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
How was I supposed to know they were women? Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Yes.
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Remember that shoe you lost...
Uh, yeah. Cut to the chase.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
That's the beauty. It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor. How about a Gates-arita? I used real hot dogs.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
You certainly do.
You certainly do.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Anybody have a cigarette? But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison. I don't care anymore. I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate. You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.

You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police. You have no proof.
Get away from there, convict!
Just browsing. Don't touch me....
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Two minutes, 35 seconds. Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Cool, isn't it? Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical. On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart. Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Alchemy.
Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin. Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out! Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Bunny, not you too?
You've got a dilemma, tiger. I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
I hate a man with a sense of humor. While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
If you think you're getting past me...
You killed a friend. Why should I help you go for the gold?
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns. Markets will crash- crash. Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.

Too bad.
Don't I know you...
You just might. I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it. At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.

No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --

Mind if I join you?
You're from Muncie?!
Why yes, do you know it?

Oh, no, really, I --

Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!

I know that, Amy.
I know that, Amy.

Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Says who?!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!

This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!

Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...

'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '

'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on

That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
I haven't had --
I haven't had --
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
Well, frankly, I...
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
...Who let you in?
I --
Tell him I'll be right there... Well, what is it?
I --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. ...Make it fast, make it fast.
You --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Wait a minute!
...education, were you?
Well, I'm a college graduate --

All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?

Oh my God, sir!

Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Oh my God, sir!
Not that way! Through the door!
But, sir!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Oh my God, sir!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!

Finally.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Well... I'm for it...
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.

Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...

Good morning, miss.
Thank you for waking me.
Thank you for waking me.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss. That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
I know, miss. But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you. You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
I know, miss. But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you. You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Thank you, Alma.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?

She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.

We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
I do my best. Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well. It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
What's this?
A puff-up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
A puff-up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.

Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?

Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer. The Holland's are a most old family, miss. They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Ti-Misery? What's that?
Ti-Misery? What's that?
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.

I think you need some help.
I'm afraid so.

Ti-Joseph?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell. I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way. I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Nonsense, child! I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately. I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think. I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica. The Fort needs a girl like you. But now we've got to get you back there. I'll walk you back and stay
Thank you, Mrs. Rand. I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
So -- he says I'm nice. He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy. But I'm worried about his drinking.
I'd love to.
Use your influence with Paul. Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.

Her son drowned. She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
Mrs. Rand.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.

But, Mrs. Rand --
But, Mrs. Rand --
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.

But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story. And not an easy one --
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him. Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and
But you didn't have to come up here.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Perhaps not. But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good. I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand...
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night. But there's nothing wrong with that. She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people, to help them.
Does she suffer?
I don't know. I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Fortunately, not. This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies. I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Thank you.
I've worked with it. I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland. The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor. The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
You're single?
Yes.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
Where were you trained?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital. I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Very well. That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements. Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.

That is good. But I'd like to know more about the case.
That is good. But I'd like to know more about the case.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.

That will mean another interview, won't it?

It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell. But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway. There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland. But you've already met him.
Yes -- on the boat.
Yes -- on the boat.
And that chair -- is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.

We're half-brothers. Paul is mother's first child. When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary. And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off. You'll have to excuse me.
Of course. It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Don't worry. I wasn't missed. The only important man here is the owner.
Mr. Holland?
Mr. Holland?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
I don't know. He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
I don't know. He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
It'll wait.
Where do you think you're going?
It's my day off.
It's my day off.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?

I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find. I'd better come along and show you the town.
But don't you have to work?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph. I have to keep the lady entertained.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.

What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?

Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement? Let me tell you. It's one of the funniest stories --
Wait. I want to listen.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
Did you hear what he sang?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Why? Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that. Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.

That doesn't sound like him.

That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand. Would you mind taking me home?
I'd like to go now, Rand. Would you mind taking me home?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her. "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica? You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?" What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words. He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
Of course, Wes.
Does she suffer? Does she know what she is?
I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
She hated sleep. She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
She hated sleep. She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Not to a nurse. Sleep is a cure.
She's dead. The dead ought to be buried.
But she's not dead, Wes.
But she's not dead, Wes.
You know what she is! That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
You know what she is! That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Please, Wes, do as I ask. You must rest, you must sleep.
No, Wes.
Jessica was never any good for Paul. You will be, you are. And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget. Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
It is not beautiful.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand. Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror. Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence. There's no beauty here -- it's death and

You can't really believe that.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Yes, thank you.
Can't I take it for you?
No, thank you. Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
A woman crying? No one's been crying here.
Why was the maid crying?
I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Yes. But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship. That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
I made it clear in my letter to the company. This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I am not a frightened girl.
I am not a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.

If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.

Of course not!
A mental case?
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
Why should you be? My wife is a mental case. Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---

Many people thought her beautiful.
I suppose so. Yes.
And charming?

I've never given it much thought.

Don't. It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great unhappiness.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Good morning.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell. On your first "day off," too.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.

Wesley can be very entertaining.

Yes, he can. But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Yes, he can. But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
It's always stood there, Miss Connell. I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.

But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.

I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.

Still, I feel you should remove the decanter. Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter. Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is. I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
You don't seem very disturbed by it. I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening. They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
I heard you playing.
I often do.
I often do.
I know what you went through tonight. I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.

Why did you come in here?
Why did you come in here?
I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
You have helped me. I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I love Fort Holland.

What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?

You didn't drive her mad.
You didn't drive her mad.
Didn't I? I don't know. That's the simple truth of it. I don't know.
Well?
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I imagined this so differently...
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..." The whole thing beginning all over again...
And instead, I came -- bringing you nothing.
And instead, I came -- bringing you nothing.
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that. Don't call it nothing.
I wanted to help you.
Help me? How?
Help me? How?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her.

You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life. There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity. Why did you do it?
I told you.
I told you.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me? Why should that mean anything to you?

You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.
You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
She was beautiful.
She was beautiful.
I hated her.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I have no defense. So far as I know -- it is true.
I have no defense. So far as I know -- it is true.
You can't believe that. You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad. You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You can't believe that. You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad. You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
How do you know I'm not? I was cruel to Jessica. When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
How do you know I'm not? I was cruel to Jessica. When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I can understand that. Everyone feels that way about someone.
I can understand that. Everyone feels that way about someone.
No. It's not just how I felt toward Jessica. I've been cruel to even you.
You wanted to warn me...
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.

Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.

I want you to be safe, Betsy. I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
I want you to be safe, Betsy. I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
You want that?
You want that?
Yes.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner. It'll pass. We've had this sort of thing before.
This is something else. They're curious. Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
This is something else. They're curious. Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
Wesley!
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right. And I will have to urge him to use it.
I think I do. I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
It's more than that, Doctor. I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I hated myself. I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.

Ah -- that's where reason took hold.

Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.

But I had no thought of harming her. It wasn't I...
You were possessed. That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind. You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols. To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie. Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
All that you say comes down to the same thing. You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
I don't know -- I don't know--
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make? Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell. It isn't a question of blame. It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica. The commissioner is very concerned.
An accident at the mill?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.

In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.

Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness. And, of course, the events which led up to it.

In other words, I'm on trial.

I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul. I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter. But there's been too much talk. The thing's out of hand.

Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand. And you are a woman with a very strong conscience. That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence. There is no such thing as a Zombie. The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it? Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
No. You're quite wrong. Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people. It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here. I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
To the asylum?
To the asylum?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.

It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Why?
Why?
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Foolish? Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
We're all in it. There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use. Say something, Paul! You've always been good with words. Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell them what you saw there.
That isn't true. You never understood her.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head. The chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together. And then I heard a voice, speaking
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?

OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another?
No thank you. We should be off.
No thank you. We should be off.
Gotcha.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
And as usual no one believed me...
You're staring at me.

The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You want to go?

What do you think?

Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
So early?

Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Hmm. Good night.
You all right there?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?

Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
That shirt?
That shirt?
What?
What?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
The turkey in?
Stuffed and baking.
Dinner in ten minutes.
You go dry off now.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it! ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.

What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a

This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --

Damn it, Ben --

I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --

You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back

Elena.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Ready to go?
We're not going anywhere.
Elena.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?

Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
About?
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well... For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Sure dad.
Sure dad.
Thanks.
See you.
Stay out of trouble.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the

Yeah?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.

After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
In a bit.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
Huh?
Birth control.
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
A prior engagement overcame me.
What?
What?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.

Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
I just can't believe you could be so --
Dad stop it!
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Fascist!
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Good-night dad.
Good night kiddo.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Nah.
Nah.
What you been up to?
What you been up to?
Nothing.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Jesus all right enough!
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
Talking to me, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
Huh?
Huh?
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
Your toes cold?
Yeah.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
C'mon.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?

That's besides the point.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?

Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --

But...
But what?
But what?
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
It was all junk!
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
What?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.

I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Thanks for the advice Dave.

Darn it, Dave.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
A key party?
A key party?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met
Thank you Janey.
It was lovely!
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Let me.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
You want coffee or something?
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --

My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and

Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.

Of course.
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Yeah. You?
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Sure. Maybe coffee.

Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --

Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?

What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
I don't like coffee.
It'll warm you up.
Please don't.
It's not a bother.

Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--

None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.

Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. When was the last time you rode a bike?
They say you never forget.

In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --

See ya.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.

Flame on, asshole.
Flame on, asshole.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
How can you do that man?
Do what?
Do what?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.

My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --

Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
No candy for me?
Groovy. Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.

Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
What is it?
Maybe you should have just a half.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Yeah.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --

Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.

My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!

How do you know this shit?
How do you know this shit?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

Good thinking Marge.
Stupid! Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Who said so?
Who said so?
No one.
No one.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Mikey?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Geometry?
Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Where you going?
Out.
Out.
It's freezing.
It's freezing.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Want some gum?
Sure. Twinkie?
Sure. Twinkie?
I'm chewing.
Did you tell Sandy?
Tell Sandy? What?
I don't ever want to see you.
Then why'd you come after me?
You have to follow me?
I dunno. I --
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.

All my model planes.
All my model planes.
The ones you built?
The ones you built?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.

Yeah.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing?

Just thought I'd stop by.

Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
Are you his girlfriend?
No.
He's dead.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Well. It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Communist Viet Cong.
Communist Viet Cong.
They left it in the jungle.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Want a drink?
Vodka?
Vodka?
You never tasted the stuff?
It feels warm.
One more shot?
One more shot?
Okay.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Huh?
Huh?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
I love you.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Yes, sir.
That's all, for now.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Good.
Good.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Sure.
Just after Leland Street.
What's that, then?
Nice kid.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
So far.
What's the D.A. got them on?
What's the D.A. got them on?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
And then I lost him. In the fog.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
I have to get back.
Too bad...
My partner...
Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to Nightmute!
You did your homework, Officer.
Actually...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't worry about him...
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
But they're so boring. All small stuff.
But they're so boring. All small stuff.
It's all about the small stuff. Small lies. Small mistakes. Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. It's human nature.
Typical seventeen year-old. She went to a party Friday night?
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
We already did.
We already did.
Do it again.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Who's that?
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
Good. He's up next.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Yeah. All over.
Yeah. All over.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. We can get it in by the morning editions.
I could say the same thing about you.
Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time.
Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time.
Who's playing?
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
She your only sibling?
Twelve years younger.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
That must have been awful for you.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Okay.
But here's the thing. I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog.
Then change it.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
Five feet? Seven feet?
Duggar called him?
About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Not really.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. You said that once, remember?
It's legitimate.
Worth pursuing?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell. Her things are in the house.
I know.
I know.
Byrd's dead.
No. But I covered it up. I lied.
Why?
What about your shoulder?
Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar.
Sorry about...
Where is he?
Thanks.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better. Take him fishing or something.

He would have liked that.

We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What I saw?
What I saw?
Anything. It's important.
Oh, you know. Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Right. Got lost in the rocks.
Right. Got lost in the rocks.
We'll get the other one, though.
No.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Like I said, no. We know about those things up here.
She left the party early. Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
What time was that?
What time was that?
Around twelve-thirty.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
We're sure it's hers?
Has her books in it.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
No.
What are you doing here?
I told her to come.
Dormer. Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now. You get the search party together. No fewer than thirty people. I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes. Don't waste any time.
I'll call him now.
First I need a copy of the key.
Forget your pager?
What?
What?
I beeped you over two hours ago.
Good.
And something else that might interest you.
No.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
That's right.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It's signed. Personally.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It's signed. Personally.
So?
So?
This is a local writer. Kay had all his books. I think we should check it out.
Where you signed this?
That's right.
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
What happened at that signing?
She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.
She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.
Did she?
Did she?
Yes. Not that much at first. But then she became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week...
She wasn't happy. I was someone to talk to.
How do you mean?
How do you mean?
That boyfriend. Randy.
Randy Stetz?
That's right.
Are you sure about that?
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night. Bruises all over her back, her upper arms. I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it. Wanted to keep it a secret.
Eight years.
Seven years.
They're all over everybody.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force." Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years. They're turning it into a witch hunt. Something on the news about it practically every night.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
Even the best make mistakes.
What do you want to talk about?
You know what about.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
When's that, a week? Two weeks?... We have to figure out a plan of action now.
When's that, a week? Two weeks?... We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know my plan of action.
You know my plan of action.
To do nothing.

We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as that.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember that?
You know I remember that.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.

Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. Every last one. And I
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
What are we thinking?
Looks like the natives are restless.
Will?
I wish I could stick it out like you. I just, with Trish and the kids...
Don't do this, Hap...
I'm thinking I could get off with probation. Keep half my pension. That's all I want.
Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're doing...
Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
Your friend's all business.
I'm always all business.
I got it. Don't know why I bother. It's been broken for two years.
Habit.
Fred Duggar?
No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I'm not expecting anyone.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
Will...I...
What is it?
What is it?
There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.
One of your cases?
Me and Hap. A year and a half ago. I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty. Smug, cold. Dead eyes. We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. Nothing concrete. Went over every inch of that apartment.
Will.
There've been other cases. Where we've changed results. Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence. But Dobbs. I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
What if someone finds out?
We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Did you love her?
Huh?
Huh?
Kay Connell. Did you love her?
"She was nice." Wow. That makes me all soft inside. Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Huh?
Huh?
You heard me that time.
You heard me that time.
She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.

After that she left the party to go to him.

How should I know?...

Ran like hell to go to him...
Ran like hell to go to him...
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
I don't know.
You don't know.
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Thought I smelled something.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You're not missing much.
You're not missing much.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I was her best friend.
Best friend?

Since grade school.

We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other.

Must be tough for you. What happened.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Long as it's fun.
Hey...
Thought you wanted something fun...
You and Kay were like sisters?
That's what I said.
That's what I said.
Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
No...
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
I don't know.
You don't know.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was?

She used some stupid code name.

What was it?

No game.
The phone call. The knapsack.
I'm sorry?
I said you're going to get a phone call.

Oh?

You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Down at the station?

She was only seventeen.
But she was an attractive girl.

I suppose.

Did you have sex with her?

He. Well, he...
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Told you I could write an ending.

Congratulations.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
What the hell do you know?
Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
It was when I went to kiss her. She started laughing. I got angry. After all I'd given her. All I'd shared with her. I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Yes. Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
You're not following procedure.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Wild card.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Monstrous.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Your lips, they didn't move.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
We had feared we were the only ones...
We had feared we were the only ones...
But how did you come into existence?
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Are you the leader of tis group?
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
Surely you know the one who made you...
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
That is a picture, nothing more.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
You mean we are not children of Satan?
No.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
Then there is nothing.
Then there is nothing.
Perhaps...
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
Then God does not exist...
Then God does not exist...
I have not spoken to him...
I have not spoken to him...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Knew? You mean he is...
I was waiting for you...
Listen to me.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
Your lover.
Your lover.
No, my beloved, my child.
No, my beloved, my child.
If you say so. You are innocent.
If you say so. You are innocent.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
She is.
She is.
But why?
But why?
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Then blame the one who made her...
Then blame the one who made her...
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.

We want no quarrel with him.
We want no quarrel with him.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Then I leave too.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
You said there were none.
You said there were none.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
We can do that?
We can do that?
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
That's what the one who made me said.
That's what the one who made me said.
How he must have loved you.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Yes... My God...
Yes... My God...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I can't save her.
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I couldn't prevent it.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You let them do it.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Louis, I swear I did not.
Louis, I swear I did not.
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must
You didn't even warm them, did you?
No.
No.
And yet you knew what I would o.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Your melancholy eyes...
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
More.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
I want some more.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
I'm not your daughter.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Why always on this night?
What night? What do you mean?
What night? What do you mean?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realise.
I didn't realise.
Is this my birthday?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
But you're the fairest by far.
But you're the fairest by far.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
It will grow back again!
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Stop her Louis!
Stop her Louis!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Does it?
Does it?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Not you my dear.
Not you my dear.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
What plans?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
We forgive each other then?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
No. Laudanum.
Laudanum!
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
I want more.
What have you done?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
He jests.
He jests.
Why does he call you that?
Why does he call you that?
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Claudia! You did that?
Sit still. It's not finished -
You want me to be a doll forever?
Claudia - don't -
Claudia - don't -
Why not?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
You... fed on me?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
You both did it?
You both did it?
I took your life. He gave you another one.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
He'll never let us go.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Don't mock, Claudia...
Don't mock, Claudia...
The swamp...
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
Louis, look at me.
I can't. Go away from me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
And you never cried -
And you never cried -
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
What was that?
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
It can't be -
It is! Take the back stairwell -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
Not yet.
How do I look?
Still my beautiful child.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Yes...
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
But how will I ever know, Louis?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
You know her?
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Come, Claudia...
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
How devilishly clever.
She's no vampire.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
This is no performance.
And no one knows but us...
This is monstrous!
Yes, and very beautiful.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Be still!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What danger?
What danger?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Love?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Never.
Never.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
That's not so.
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
So you felt it too!
So you felt it too!
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
He can protect us, Claudia.
You really believe that?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Yes...
Yes...
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
But if she dies...
But if she dies...
It's only mortal death.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
They would have killed you -
Then my luck would have changed.
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
You want death? Is it death you want?
Yes...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Why should I be?
What do you want from me?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Diane!!!!
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
NO!!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Give it to me!!!
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
How do you mean, start?
How do you mean, start?
Call him.
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
You've just done it -
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Did I hear a yes?
Yes...
You're sure?
Sure...
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Dying?
Come, you're going to feed now.
I want a woman.
Take him.
The crucifix -
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
What have I done?
You have fed. You were made for this...
Dear God, what have I done?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
It can't be...
It can't be...
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
And if I don't?
And if I don't?
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
Do you think so?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Fascination...
Fascination...
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Have you ever been caught?
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
But how do you know?
But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
I can't.
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I don't know any hell -
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Paris? You came from Paris?
Paris? You came from Paris?
As did the one who made me.
As did the one who made me.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
You fool, what have you done?
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where are we?
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
We belong in hell.
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
I don't pretend to know.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
The girl, Lestat -
I know. Let her alone.
Why do you do this Lestat?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Lestat - finish this -
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Unless I make her one of us...
NO!!!
NO!!!
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
No...
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
That and more.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Lestat!
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I didn't want to kill her.
I didn't want to kill her.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Lestat, what do you mean?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
No... You come back to me Louis...
Are you mad????
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
CLAUDIA!!!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
That's all past, Lestat.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
It's only a siren...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
And they frighten you?
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.

It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
I have to go now Lestat...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
Yes. I remember...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
I tried...
I tried...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
You have it...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -

You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.

So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You followed me here, didn't you?
You followed me here, didn't you?
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
It's just a room...
It's just a room...
So shall we begin? What do yo do?
So shall we begin? What do yo do?
I'm a vampire.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
How did you do that?
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You're not lying to me, are you?
You're not lying to me, are you?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
Yes.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
You can't look at them...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
The story about stakes through the heart?
The story about stakes through the heart?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
What about coffins?
What about coffins?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
You loved Yvette...
Can a vampire feel love?
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
You loved your wife, surely.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Shall we go on?
He did it to make you stay with him!
He did it to make you stay with him!
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Did he die in the fire?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
You found nothing?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.

No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Lestat escaped the fire!
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
No... it can't end like that...
But it has. There is no more to tell.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
It's over, I'm telling you...
It's over, I'm telling you...
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
No...
No...
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
You promise to care for her then?
Yes...
Yes...
And you know what you ask for?
Yes.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
A child who can't die...
And the child who did die?
My daughter...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Yes!
What can I do for you?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
You're in 201 and 202.
Is that bad?
Is that bad?
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
What about a radio?
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
What the hell would you call this?
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Your what?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Storm season?
It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Listen to me. He's here.
Who? Who is here?
I want off this island.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Stupid. Stupid.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
No.
No.
The guy looks dead.
Get lost, you scared me.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Say yes.
No.
No.
No means yes.
No means yes.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
That could break the machine.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
The number's unlisted...
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Okay, okay. You're right.
I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
He does work hard.
He does work hard.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Then, don't.
Oh!
Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
I'm the King of the World.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Hello? Hello?
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here.
Karla! You promised.
Karla! You promised.
I also promised Tyrell.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But...
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
Don't even think about it.
Okay, I won't.
No way.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me...no way...
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
You get any sleep at all?
Some.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Nice move.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Cancer in a box.
No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach.
Karla!
Just kidding.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
They never found the body.
Julie...
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Let him go. I believe him.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
What do you mean?
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Be careful, Julie.
I've got to see.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Then, we fight --
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
It's too late for that.
There's no way to lock it.
What do we do?
I don't know...
Come on, you can make it.
Julie?
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
Ray, I can't...
Can't what?
Can't what?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
I understand something.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
It's okay.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know...
This weekend?
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Will you try...for me, please?
Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye.
Ray...what are you doing?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
Never do that again.
Never do that again.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
I love it here.
It's gonna be great.
Checking the locks again?
You know me to well.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Fine. Show me the body.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Who?
Who?
Ben Willis.
Voodoo.
I told you.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
Don't kill me --
Wait, it's Nancy --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You sure?
You sure?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
The shower again?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It was one year ago...
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
To get out of Southport?
To get out of Southport?
Right. Now I remember.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
This was not my idea.
What?
What?
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Deep breaths --
Deep breaths --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.

You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
It beets being on the mainland.
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
Julie? What's wrong?
It's...him.
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
It's in my room!
There was a body! I swear it!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Did you get help?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Why are you doing this to me?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
I trusted you.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
...Why?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
I'll talk real slow.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Is there a problem here?
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Oooh, the mainland --
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Rio, baby!
Pretty cool bar.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister?
Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street.
Why?
Why?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Hey --
Hey --
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I'll come with you.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
I'm not hiding up no tree. I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
You think that's a good place to hide?
I don't know, but I'm starving.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
To a great weekend --
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Ahh, that feels great.
How's Julie?
How's Julie?
Alone. In the room. Got any advise?
Why? He can't help us.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Yes!
Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country?
Okay, Karla, five seconds. Five...Four...
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
How much?
How much?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Well, there's some flaws in her...
How much?
Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
You guys lost?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Wanna drink?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
He leave you?
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
What's going on?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Cool.
Cool.

I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
And so could you -- crazy fool.

You stumbled into my hiding place.

Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up. I've never seen a dead body before.
Can't talk right now.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can't sail.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
So why are you still here?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
How's the water?
How's the water?
Crowded.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
You don't have to be a jerk.
Where is everybody?
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --

Hey -- shut up, okay?
Take this.
And do what with it?
They were cut loose.
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
Where'd Estes go?
What is up with that weirdo?
What is up with that weirdo?
I'll go find him.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?

This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.

How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.

The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world. But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
Where is Miss Wollsten?
She's in her room.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis. To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.

It is my home. My name is Hugo Albrecht.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
He is exhausted.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr. Jacks 
Drunk again?
Drunk again?
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk  he staggered.
That staggering. His dying so quickly. In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
In case you do so, would you --
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.

Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.

Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Goodbye.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
Good winds and bad winds!
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
You're just talking nonsense.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
We will see who is the first to die.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
) You feel the symptoms?
My friend -- what can one say --
My friend -- what can one say --
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
This was once a cemetery.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here. I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
They were gore before I came here.
They were gore before I came here.
But why?
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
All the graves?
All the graves?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I donut understand.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
We will know when the next one sickens. Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
We will know when the next one sickens. Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others. Let them think it was a normal And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow. I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
No. She shall not be left here.
No. She shall not be left here.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
M~ father will take care of it. Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe. I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache. I'm so sorry.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..

Thank you.
Good night, Oliver.
Sleep well.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I think not.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
No one can take my father's place.
Where's Thea?
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
On my word! That's what they believe.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Poor Cathy --
Poor Cathy --
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days. I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
I don't know now without my father.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
She has never mentioned her family.
She has never mentioned her family.
How old is she?
What are you doing?
I was looking for you.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs -- You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.

The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
You are fortunate in your father.
Thea is an orphan.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
What an odd question!
What an odd question!
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
I have forgotten it, dear.
My last name is Pherides.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
But one must love a father.
But one must love a father.
The General  you don't even know him.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
I felt he did not like me.
That should decide it or you --
That should decide it or you --
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
She is dead  at peace.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
It was, the plague
It was, the plague
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Whet do you mean?
Whet do you mean?
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.

You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you can't get your own way.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
How do you know what my father thought - -

That your father and I 
No. I mean your other secret - the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?

Really, this is idiotic!
Really, this is idiotic!
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
You wouldn't tell that 
You wouldn't tell that 
Wouldn't I?
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.

I don't care who he is. He doesn't know. He can't tell 
Woman, what are you doing here?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..

You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?

Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Her name is Thea?
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
Theodosia.
Her family name?
Her family name?
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.

I will go with you.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
Hero?
Hero?
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
You know that sound, Oliver?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur. What do you expect after a battle?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur. What do you expect after a battle?
You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
Do you mind if I go with you?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.

Oh, now  now look here 

I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.

But that should make you like her.
It makes me fear her.
I can't understand that.
I can't understand that.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
We have no time for that.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?

Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
But the war, the army  they need you.

Thea is so like her  in every feature 
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
How did she die?
How did she die?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.

You're crying. Why?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --

What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
You see? Thea believes it, too!
Thea, what's wrong?
The General threatened me.
The General threatened me.
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble  the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.

I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
It is for that he hates me.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Because she loved him. I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.

All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Then foreclose!
Then foreclose!
I can't do that. These families have children.
But they're somebody's children.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Well, all right . . .
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

Who?

The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Get that ladder up here.
All right  all right.

Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I'm hurrying.
George . . .
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Stand back.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
I hate to do this, fella.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Don't . . . George?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?

Yeah, very funny.
Yeah, very funny.
Well . . . . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.

Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Go through with what?
Go through with what?
Suicide.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?

Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
By letting me help you.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.

Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
What'd you say?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . . . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Our clothes are dry.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
You have no car.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . . . . . or you are!
It isn't me!
It isn't me!
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
No.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Made what?
Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
No, of course not.
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . .
What?
Zuzu's petals.
You know where he lives?
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .

If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I'm not supposed to tell.

Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful!
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
A boy?
A boy?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.

Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.

Yes, but what happened to George?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
No!
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Yes, but George . . .
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.

Splendid! Is he sick?

Thanks.
Thanks.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Thank you very much.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
What's that?
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.

Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Is this the place?
Of course it's the place.
Of course it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.

Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?

I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hey, George . . .

Where are you going?

Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Huh?
Huh?
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a
George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, George, don't . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
I know, but . . .
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Say hello to New York for me.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Violet Bick!
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.

It's important.

There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Peanut?
Hello.
How do you do.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Right down here.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
That way, huh?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George . . .
Why didn't you call me?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?

And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
The whole town's gone crazy.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Hello?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yeah . . . . . . you can take this one off now.
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.

We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Now look, did you buy anything?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
This way.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
Pop!
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Pop!
They're not my children.
Yes, sir.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'd like to do that.
I'd like to do that.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
All right, sir.
Yes, sir.
Have you notified the police?
Have you notified the police?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Five hundred dollars.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.
With coconuts?
I don't like coconuts.
I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Well, hello.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.

I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Beautiful.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?

Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
You may kiss my hand.
You may kiss my hand.
Ummmmm . . .
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
In that place?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
What'd you wish, George?
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college
Oh, no.
Come on, tell me.
Come on, tell me.
If I told you it might not come true.
If I told you it might not come true.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'll take it. And then what?
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?
Ouch!
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
I'm going to scream!
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
How's that?

My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Didn't you tell her?
Didn't you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
When did you get back?
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?

It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Thank you.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Don't you like her?

Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.

Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Right.
How long ago?
About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight....
I can't let you take her out.
You can't stop me.
Mike's out there.
But I signed for the boat. You' re not authorized any more.
Untie that rope.
Please. It's my job.
You're too close. Back off.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
I'm going out there.
Hey -- you can't do that.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Never mind that shit. Just point.
See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it.
Got it.
Where to?
No place special. Just hanging out.

You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.

What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?

Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.

I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh? We've had a lot of trouble.
Okay, okay.
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
Pop....
You stay right here. You're going in with me.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Not till next year.
Michael.
Yeah?
Yeah?
You want to come here a minute?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I kind of had plans....

Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
Hey, come on....
Hey, come on....
No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts.
Mike? Is that you?
Pop. I'm sorry.
Pop. I'm sorry.
It's okay. What happened?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
At least you're safe. What about the others?
Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
Sean's still out there.
What?
Dad, I'm sorry....
Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure....
You said something about a camera.
You said something about a camera.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....

Did you get any pictures?
Did you get any pictures?
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though....
What else you got?
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?

Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
All of us thank you, okay?
May I have this dance?
Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.
Wait a minute....
Too late, it's written.
Too late, it's written.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Temporarily? Uh...sure....
It came up during the meeting.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Is that what it is?
Is that what it is?
You're damn right that's what it is.
What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Some- thing in the lens.
My ass!
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us? That could ruin us.

Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.

What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever!
As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Look at that:
First things first.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.

You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Could be a shark. But maybe not.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.

Do you?

I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan....
Carcharadon Carcharias.

Okay, so that's it.

So there's one around here.
So there's one around here.
Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.

Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....

Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Where the hell were you?
Late.
Late.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Do I have to talk to those two?
My boss and your boss. Sure.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Why?
Why?
Because they're playing our song.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.

So's a donut.
Eat Cheerios.
What're you guys doing today?
Where's my day book?
In the den.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat He's another one.

In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?

Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
