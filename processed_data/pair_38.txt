Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.

Oh, that.

Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.

Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
Nobody knew!
It is over.
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will.

Where are you going?
To my weekly confession.
Now where? Will?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
I feel a scene coming on.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Will! Have you finished?
Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.

We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.

By God, I wish I knew.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.

No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .

But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Oh, but they can!

There was a wager, I remember as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Your Majesty!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts. How much was the wager?

I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?

You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?

You cannot marry Wessex!

If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
No no.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Will you read it for me?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
" thou need'st not to be gone."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.

And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.

He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Who was it?

So we'll meet him, then?
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'

It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
What?
What?
Unfeasible.
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't thinkI can.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
OK.
OK.
David?
Be careful.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.
Stop nagging.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.
For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.
Who was it?
Who was it?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
No.
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Will you calm down.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
It tastes different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.
David?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Forget it.
Forget it.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
And the money?
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Expecting anyone?
No.
No.
Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
You're frightened.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?
I'll wait there.
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
Alex.
What?
What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't you ever stop?
Don't you ever stop?
No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.
I see.
I see.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
So, uh...
What?
What?
What?
What?
You were going to say something.
You were going to say something.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?
Yeah.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
What about?
What about?
It's about the burglary.
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Downstairs.
Of course.
Of course.
Can we come in?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
did you hear anything before he cries?
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Two?
Who said there were four?
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.
Yes, absolutely.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Someone lost the key.
Is this where no one stays?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
Yes.
That wasn't a question.
Why do you want a room here?
Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Did you ever kill a man?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Is this what they always look like?
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Would you like to talk about it?
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Do you know many of these people?
Yes. They're my friends.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred.

Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
That's what it cost, David.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Expecting anyone?
What?
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?

No one.
No one.
If I think you're lying --
I thought you'd gone to work.
With a face like this?
I'm sorry.
I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.
It was on the television.
So let's go.
You and me?
Yes.
And you need your sleep.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?

That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
What do we do here, David?
Sorry?
Sorry?

Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.

I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.

I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I know, honey.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.

Well that's something.
Well that's something.
What is.

You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Oh, Christ.
That was him.
Yes.
Yes.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.

Where did this come from?

Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.

Obviously there were others, weren't there?

Jesus.
What? What? What? What? What?

I said you were a loser!
What're you here for?

You need a cut.

But Mr. Norman said --
But Mr. Norman said --

I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut. But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
I see.
It's an unusual trade.
Yes it is.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
In a way. But...
In a way. But...
But what?
But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's good you want to do something, George.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
They're not?
They're not?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
You're right.
You're right.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Sure.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?
When?
Tonight?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Okay.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know what you mean.
Sorry, honey, I...
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... she's very upset...
What about, tonight?
What about, tonight?
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.

I know it, I know it.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Oh, hey...
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
-- yeah?
-- yeah?
See she doesn't drink too much.
Well anyway...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Isn't that bad for it?
Isn't that bad for it?
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
This really ought to be layered...
Layered?
Layered?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
You live like a pig.
Yeah. How long have you been here?
Yeah. How long have you been here?
All night.
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...

Sit down.
Sit down.
But...
But...
I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.

I wanna hear about it.
What can I say!
What can I say!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!

Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about,
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to

Who?

Me!
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or

No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
You really think so?
Yes I do.
Yes I do.
I'm finished with her.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

Then you were talking to him.
Then you were talking to him.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Of course not.
Of course not.
That's not very logical, Lester.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Really? How about starting with tonight?
You and your touchy investors.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Fine.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well, he is.
So what's your point?
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I know, I'm sorry.
I know, I'm sorry.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?

George is great but I know what you mean.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.

I guess not.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
You're really a love -- you sure?
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It must be something.

Well, it's George.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
-- Yeah, honey...
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?

After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.

Well yes -- you know that about George.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
Honey?
What?
What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.

C'mon.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
Well, there was this one time --
-- Yesss?

-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Didn't you have any panties on?
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Egypt?
That's right.
That's right.
But why Egypt?
But why Egypt?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Oh. thank you.
Sure.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.

I'm terribly sorry.

What does he do? Is he an actor?
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
-- no.
Good for you.

He's a hairdresser.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Well... sure...
Well... sure...
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That bastard.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- oh I don't know --
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Let's do that.
-- why?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Of course not.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Two weeks from tomorrow.

Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?

What's wrong?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- he'll never know the difference.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...

That's fine --

Thank you.
Thank you.

You seem disappointed.
No... how long did you say?

Thanks for coming by.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.
No of course not.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Everything okay, son?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Call me Les.
Where to, Les?
Where to, Les?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Dad?
Yes?
Yes?
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Come here for a minute, first.
How's it going, Doc?
Okay.
Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad. Dad?
I am, Dad. Dad?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
No. I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't. I have too much to do.
I can't. I have too much to do.
Dad?
Dad?
Yes?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?
I guess so.
I guess so.
Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Dad?
What?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat. You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?
No.
You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yeah.
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.
How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.
Yes.
Do they know he tell you things?
I don't know.
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.
Maybe he showed me something.
Try to think what it was.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Is there something bad here?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.

No I ain't.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out!
Yeah.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?

Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Okay.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.
Okay, Mom.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...
Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Okay. You behave yourself.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
All right.
All right.
And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?

Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Well all right. But really don't make a sound.
I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Okay, Mom.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves. That's all there is to it.

No.
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?

No. It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Oh,

Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?
Do I have to?
Do I have to?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Shall we go into the living room?
Yes.
Please...
Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Tony.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
What sort of injury did he have?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Well how can I repay you?
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Sure.
Great. Sit down. Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir. It tends to stain.
Advocaat is it?
Advocaat is it?
Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one.
Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Fine.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
And, er... where are they now?
Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
How?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
She eh... interferes.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady.
Grady... oh.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the only thing to do.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening. Forest Service.
Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much. I'll do that.
Thank you very much. I'll do that.
All right, sir.
Good evening. Forest Service.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Sure.
Sure.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes? We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
I'm a Wendy.
I'm a Wendy.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
God. This is the kitchen, huh?
God. This is the kitchen, huh?
Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Beg pardon?
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
I did?
Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
What line of work are you in now?
What line of work are you in now?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
What'll it be?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not to busy, are
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks.
Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em!
Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'll it be, sir?
No charge?
Your money's no good here.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, babe.
Hi, hon. How's it going?
Hi, hon. How's it going?
Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Uh...huh.
Sure is.
God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.
Yeah.
Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Hmm, nice.
It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas. No good ones.
Well, something'll come. It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Yeah... that's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
What do you want me to do about it?
Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work.
Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
Yes.
Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes.
Yes.
Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
It's okay. It's okay, now. Really.
It's okay. It's okay, now. Really.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No. It's the truth, really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub. She tried to strangle him.
Which room was it?
Did you find anything?
No, nothing at all.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing. How is he?
He's still asleep.
Good.
Somebody did that to him.
I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Jack...
Jack...
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Jack!
How do you like it?
I...
I can't really remember.
I can't really remember.
You can't remember.
I don't know.
I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
Yes...
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.
Jack...
Of course I am.
Of course you are.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me!
Why?
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me! Please...
Stop swinging the bat.

I'll bring back a doctor.

Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Have any trouble finding us?
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
Susie.
Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Oh, it sure would be
Only in a very general way.
Well...
Well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.

Well, that sounds fine to me.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...

Not for me.

How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?

They'll love it.
They'll love it.
Great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
I don't believe they did.
Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
shut in together over long periods of time.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, obviously some people can be
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
No, my son's discovered the games room.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.
Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
I'd better collect my family first.
Oh...
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Well, it's very... homely.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was. We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
Royalty?
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh!
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Oh, I'll say.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Yes.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
How do you do?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Fine.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
What time does the plane leave?
Eight thirty.
Eight thirty.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Fine.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Uncle Al-
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.

Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.
Sure, Uncle Al.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
The moon's not down yet...
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What's the money for?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Stop it!
Yes. Go away.
Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Where's Mom?
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Please, Uncle Al.
Will you?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Jane-
Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
You're a real booger, you know it?
You booger.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What's that?
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
For getting a divorce?
Well... it is his third.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
There's something else scary.
What?
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Rats...
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Mom-!
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
You all right, Marty?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
No.
No.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Huh?
Huh?
What if it's some kind of monster?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.

Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Don't call me dear boy.
Don't call me dear boy.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
What?
What?
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Do I need one?
Do I need one?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.

I don't get you.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
Sure.
Good.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Yeah! What is it?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah, I know. It's great!
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Yeah... sure.
Yeah... sure.
Save this one for last.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.

Was it a prescription?

What the hell does that matter?

It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.

Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Well... was it a prescription?
Well... was it a prescription?
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.

What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!

You want to know what I think?
You want to know what I think?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
I told you!
I told you!
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
There! You see!
There! You see!
It could have been anything, Marty.
It could have been anything, Marty.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
No.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Will you do it?
Yeah? Really?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
But Uncle Al! You said-
But Uncle Al! You said-
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What if I say no?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
We won't!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I will- be good, kids.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Oh?
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
Well... thank you.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.

Really.
Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
Well... yes. Yes it is.
Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
What about crack? You a user?
What about crack? You a user?
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
How come? Sister?
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not.
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
Probation?
Well, what about the sex stuff? What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
And you listen to that?
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
What you do?
What you do?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
You know it.
What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road.
His ashes?
With love.
Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
What?
What?
You can handle this.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What?
What?
That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.
Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say?
What did who say?
What did who say?
Who? The other woman. Your wife.
You are so damn sexy.
Vince...
Vince...
How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession.
You did what?
For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.
What?
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
You bastard!

We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You pig!
Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God!
You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
No... it's fine.
Yes?
Yes?
Thanks. A lot.
Thanks. A lot.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Sure.

And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
Right. Yeah. Forgotten.
Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
Good evening, Vincent.
Good evening, Vincent.
What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.
Right here. Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Joey -- do it.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are...
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.

Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
Right.
Where did that come from?
I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
Not in years.
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
Why?
To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.

But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.

Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?

I love my heddles. Show me again.
Is this... choir practice?
Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
Hold on.
Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us?
You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Chops?
Chops?
The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
Two days. An hour or so.
No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.
That machine.
I know. It's ancient.
I know. It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section. The beat.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Am I?
All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Because we're
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers.
What is it, Mary?
That man -- who is he?
Jackpot! Two buckets
This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Hurry, Sister!
Get moving. I'm right behind you.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

Were you wicked?
Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
Enough jabber.
What?
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
Like this place?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton.
Shirelles.
You know that song?
Soprano or alto?
Whatever.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Sure. Kind of... free-lance.
Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
What?
What?
You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to.
Mary Robert.
Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.
I knew that.
I knew that.
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.
Wet behind the ears.
Wet behind the ears.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
It'll be hell.
Tell me about it.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!

Is there any syrup?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Van Cartier.
You know? About me? About everything?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
You re okay -- for a civilian.

Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?
You have to help me
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.

No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She won't? Why not?
She won't? Why not?
She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
She said that? Reverend Mother?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
What?
What?
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!
Now you.
We need experience.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over.

Experience! Right?
Experience! Right?
Right.
I have to do this. So I can become a nun.

This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
I'm getting experience.

Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.

Honey.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!
Keep moving!
Goddamn it!
Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!
Experience!
What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
What?
Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.

Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
We're nuns!
It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift.
A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
Are you leaving us?
Oh no. We'll always be together.
The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
They're from my old convent.
Run! Take off!
Again?
But what do they want? Where are we going?
She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.

I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope.

Of course. But it's almost lunch.
Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?

How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Would you like that?
Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Can do.
No! No! I can't do this!
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.

We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer.
Sometimes it's not enough!
You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?

How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
Really catching on.
Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!

Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
So... hi there.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.

Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!

Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I am?
I am?
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
What?
What?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
No. No.
No. No.
You're my Olympic event.

The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.
I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.

Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.

Please let me try. I'm begging you.

And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A vote?
A vote?
Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But... wait a minute...
The majority has spoken.
You sent for me?
You have a phone call.
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
Really. Well, that makes two of us.

But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.

Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
Oh?
You saved my life.
You saved my life.
I'm a Christian.
Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole.
Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you.
I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.

I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing.
He didn't do you a favor.

I hate you. I totally hate you.

Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

I just need a few more weeks,
But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.

I think they'd understand.
I think they'd understand.
That's not the point! They need me!
They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.

Nuns?
What're you doing?
Even nuns have to pee.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.

Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?

Where's who?
Where's who?
You won't even tell us?
You won't even tell us?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We're looking for Mike.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Who are you guys?
Who are you guys?
We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting.
But you didn't tell me!
We didn't tell you what?
We didn't tell you what?
That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
A nun?
I'm telling you!
Vince -- is she... okay?
Maybe.
And if she runs?
Take care of it.
He's so damn cocky. This is different.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's a bluff, Vince.
You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got.
It's done?
Not... totally.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
It didn't happen.
I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Yeah...
Well?
It didn't work, Vince.
It didn't work, Vince.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Right.
So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
Maybe pants.
Get her!
Which one!
There she is!
Which one?
I can't see anything in here!
Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?
Where is she?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad!
So that guy in the bar was right? She's like... some kind of nun?
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
She's gettin' away!
Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
You didn't shoot!
Neither did you!
Neither did you!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
That's what I figured, too.
Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
A sweater.
And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye.
What's she doing?
She's praying.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.
It should be here any minute.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp.
We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence.
We're losing it.
Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
That should have tipped us.
We've got to save her!
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes?
Yes?
I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Really...
She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.
Peace on Earth.
However, we can also pray for other things.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Measles.
Is this like your old convent?
Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
We did it! We actually sang a chord!
That was exciting!
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
He's decent.
He's kind.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
It's brought people back to the church.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence! Sister!
It's no use. She just isn't here.
We can't sing without her! What should we do?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
An... entertainer?
She wasn't a nun?
Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
She's our inspiration!
It's so beautiful...
And what a lovely name. Las Vegas...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
But how do we get there?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
A Benedictine.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Christy.
Not a note.
Impossible.
I don't understand. Where is she?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.
Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.
She said they were from her old convent.
But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But where?
Reverend Mother?
Yes?
Yes?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?
Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

I lied.

I know.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
And you'll face that danger head-on. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold? Can you try?
She's a nun, Vince.
I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love?
And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind.
She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up.
She's... she's a nun.
Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
We both missed.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Where?
Find 'em!
If we could speak alone.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Many have.
Many have.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Hail, Constable. How are you?
Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Um... I... I did not... no. Why?
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl. Her things are gone. Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. What about breakfast, woman? Or, am I to starve to death?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
How did you hear this?

He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Certainly not.
Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
What the hell are you doing?
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.
They spend two days in chains.
Two days... ? For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.

I hit him square.

I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I was afraid of this.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
To place it inside its coffin.
No bleeding.
What is that?
What is that?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
We must be a curious sight to him.
What are you spying on?
What are you spying on?
The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
He is a behemoth.
A diseased monster.
The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.
Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you.

He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.

You need to sleep.

You need rest.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.
What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.
What?
What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
It is sacrilege!
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
I will not allow it. I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.

Your superiors are two days away!

Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
For poaching. Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say.

You cannot do this. I am a man of God!

Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God.
Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell.
Pardon me?
Just a moment... Are you saying it is he?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow. Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.

May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm? See them?

May we look at them now?

Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.
Maybe you should take this.
A fine idea.
Damn... damn... damn...
Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Well... that might be... helpful.
Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered.
He drowned. Anyone could see.
He drowned. Anyone could see.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.

Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Have they nothing to fear presently?

Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts.

There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands. It is named Sleepy Hollow. Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Chosen me?
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.

Not for lack of trying.

Just so. Granted. And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?

I shall, gladly.
I shall, gladly.
Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning.
Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have time alone. You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.
More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.
No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land.
The Widow Windsor.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected. We sent for the militia.
The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next...
And now Jonathan Masbath.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?

... found the body this morning. You do believe now, don't you?
Believe?
What is that you wear?
My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.

Well... so much for common sense.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse. For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our dead.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I know it.
Listen to what you say....
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...

Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.

I did not ask you to, did I?
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
How could he?
How could he?
His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?
Up.
What is it?
It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Out there. What do you see?
The Western Woods.
The Western Woods.
Look again.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What kind of nuts?
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
No, I couldn't...
I have others. All I need is this.
Thank you.
Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Father said witches live there.
Father said witches live there.
Witches do not exist. However...
What is it?
Listen.
Listen.
I hear nothing.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs.
We are leaving.
What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.
Should we go back?
Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man. It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.

Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?

Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.

Stay back.
Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?

Why this tree?
Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Man or woman?

All I saw was their lantern.

If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What good is this?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it.
Yes.
Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?

No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.

Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
Did your father take a loan?
Yes. I rode with him on payment days.
There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I was getting worried. Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
What was she doing?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No. They are all missing.
There are no other doors. This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing.
It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
What books?
Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
But, sir... what books? Where are they?
What now? Where is she?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church. Find her at all costs. Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?
You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.
This is farewell.
Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here.
Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here.
I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper and his wife will look after you. They will. You will be well cared for.
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
Lady Van Tassel...
I know. Hold on.
What can we do?
Take the reins.
What now?
I doubt that's the end.
How are you?
Tired.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Did they tell? It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone. According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.

I've read a great deal about your New York City. Do be a dear and tell me all about it. Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons. Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute. And, still others believe none of it.

Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Use caution.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
No. She has gone out.
No. She has gone out.
Where?
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Very little. I must be going...
It appears well. It has already clotted.
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine. Now, I must...
I know you saw me.
What... ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
Let her go!
Yes... yes. I think I will...
Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
I can show exactly.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?
I didn't see none.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
What did you say?
Turn around. Now!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Yes. Here...
Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?
You are from the Hollow?
You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him? The Redman? I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Leave me. You are not welcome here.
I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and back.
The Horseman. Yes.
The Horseman. Yes.
Sit.
Can you help?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him.
What... what are you doing?
Close your mouth! Keep silent.
Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.
Doctor, he is awake.
You... you are alive.
Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
He rides tonight.
Father saw you die.
Father saw you die.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled. Things I wanted him to see. But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me. Baltus did not stay enough to see that. He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant. A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon. But... I am not going to kill you. Not me...
Go home.
May I see my mother?
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
She has confessed.
No.
No.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. Do you know what confession is? All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with. Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too." Get it? That's a goodun.

Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Thank ye.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.

You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.

No, don't guess I do. Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.

I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.

Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything. But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.

But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.

Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.

Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
No sir.
No sir.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you. Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I
I ain't sure.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
I want to watch T.V.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Stop it, Doyle!
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I hate you!
I hate you!
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure, I guess.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You like that Vaughan?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
You got that shit right.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
That's funny. You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I thought I told you to keep out!
What's in your bag?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.

Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.

I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.

Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that. I aim for you to have these books.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
You don't want to give away all your books.

Okay.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop. He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.

He ain't ever okay to me.
You all right, Mama?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Did Karl go to bed?
Did Karl go to bed?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.

Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you.

He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.

We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
You walk fast, don't you?
I reckon.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.

They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.

Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job. You follow me? Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go

He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Karl, you up?

Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Tolerable, I reckon.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
You scared me.

Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
I'll be dog.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?

Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?

It's all right. You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his

That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well?
Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
I believe you. I really do.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
All right then.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?

Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind. I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night
I reckon not.
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.

I've heard it said that way.
I've heard it said that way.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it

I wouldn't never hurt them.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Oh. How about before that?
Oh. How about before that?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.

Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Naw, not yet. I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy. You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.
I know.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.

Karl is a guy guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I'm sorry.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?

I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?

Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.

Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?

No thank you.
No thank you.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed,
I knew he slept in a toolshed.

His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--

Before they were married?
Before they were married?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.

That's really strange. What does it mean?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?

It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.

Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.

He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.

Signs?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Is he leaving right this minute?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

Where will he go?

Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.

As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Why?
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.

You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?

Yes.
Yes.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?

And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.

And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.

Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.

Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.

I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman. Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.

They're all the same.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather. That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.

It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, man, good to see you.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
How old, kid?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too. It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.

If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
He's crazy.
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.

It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?

You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Not a peep.

So what did he say when he called?
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things. Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.

You usually get two.

Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health.

Ah-hah.
Fine. Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.

Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea. You know anything about Christmas stories?

Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
You got it.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.
Okay. You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?

Every word.

Okay. So this is the story of how it happened. Okay. It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial. A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around
Did you ever go back to see her?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.

She probably died.

You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.

Anything for art, eh, Paul?

I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.

You're looking good, Auggie.

No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful. What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful. What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
I don't want to talk about it. If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.

You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.

Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant. I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.

That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist.

Jesus Christ. This is all I need.

She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration.

They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on.

Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.

Those are pretty hostile words.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear

Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink.

Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.

Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.

Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.

Not a one.

Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.

Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
What's your offer?

Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it? It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.

Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.

Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?

Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all

I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay. It's all so stupid. There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.

I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don't run into him again.

So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then
Why don't you go to the police?

No, not the end. The beginning. His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just

I just did.
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here we are. Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us. Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a

Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.

Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future. Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?

The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
No wonder he was angry.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
What are you talking about? You can't be serious.
What are you talking about? You can't be serious.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.

I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.

Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hi, kid.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story. That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
It's all right. I really do know them.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?

I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.

Fries?

Yes, please.
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?

Yes, please.
You want another one of these, too?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Keep it tonight. We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Seven acres. I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. Just curious, is all.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
The battery's in, that's done with. Besides, you'd do the same for m...
...<u>might</u> do the same. I have to warn you 'bout that, chief. I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
I am a bastard. I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch. And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Oh, yeh?
Oh, yeh?
Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less. You got no choice on that.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down? Just bein' curious, is all.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was <u>human</u>, yes? Type B positive.
Carl Heine's type.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.
That's obvious.
That's obvious.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff. Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Bits of blood and wood. What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
None.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...

I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I don't know.
You don't.
With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
They fished t'gether. Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person. Like any friend.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land. So...?
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...
Why? If they could never take title.
Why? If they could never take title.
Their kids was born here. So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity.
In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean. Wanted to talk to my son.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?

That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.

Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
A thousand.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Is that your third question?
Is that your third question?
It is.
It is.
You done your math right.
Now, Mister Gi...
Unwritten rule of the sea. We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
It's a joke. Maneuver up to Carl's boat? Tie your lines fast? Come aboard? All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
It's a joke. Maneuver up to Carl's boat? Tie your lines fast? Come aboard? All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Couldn't get on the boat. I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller. <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink. And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size. It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car. Nobody does.
Boat has two batteries. Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>? So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help. And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Well, what if?
Well, what if?
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here. Specially for Mr. Hooks.
I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him. And relieved.
Happy for him. And relieved.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
Closer to eight.
So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about? Everything was up in the air.
Up in the air? Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
We discussed that. And decided not to.
Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Well, it seems to me...
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
It seems human. To me.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...

I said. No further questions.
He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
Easy. Slow is best.
The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
My mom. Would be the problem.
Why? We're only talking.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank. We have a few dol...
It'll be over soon. I can get you money.
It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n...
Look at my face. It's the face of the people who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I don't mean everyone. Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a newspaper.
I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her.
I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...

I'm married, Ishmael. It isn't right for us to be alone. People will t...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There's no half- way. As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Did you write that column?
I did. But the jury won't s...
I did. But the jury won't s...
It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
You don't believe in God anymore.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose. Such a travesty...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid.
They're not his neighbor, like you are. He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it. Nightmares, tears, b...
...but he found you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.

So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
More than eager. He was out to make a point.
Well, what then, sergeant?
What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow.
And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Oh, in a heartbeat.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
These are fishermen, Alvin. They don't talk at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest.
And the next one...?
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

And the last...?
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
Pretty darn clear.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?' And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Did you say more?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun- butt. A right-handed fella, to be precise.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun- butt. A right-handed fella, to be precise.
And why. Is that?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times. Looked exactly like this one.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.

My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?

All right. What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?

Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Tht was summation, Your H...
Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side.
Objection! Speculation.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right. For your little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood. The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern. The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair. That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Twelve.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.
Then putting them together. So truth is revealed.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Oh, yes.
Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Like you couldn't believe.
Greedy.
He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
That's how journalists. Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful. At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
That's curious. I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.

No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Robbed. He was angry.
Oh, yeh. He said someday he would get his land back.
Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Carl Heine came.
But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at it.
He said he didn't want that life no more. He'd been saving to buy a farm. He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion. I didn't have a lawyer...
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney. You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>. Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes. Initially.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I should have told everything right away. I know that now, and I regret it.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
I have told the truth.
I have told the truth.
You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir.
I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
Yes.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
You have the night watch? On the radio.
Since September. Last guys got transferred.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet. Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
How long you have this detail?
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th. We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.
I did. Boy.
Three kids. What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.
Won't take two.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Have a look. At nothing.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
You're right. I better use two.
It's on the twine, too. But it's not r...
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
No, you don't.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
You're wondering why I held it.
You're wondering why I held it.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.
Your daddy. Was quite a feller.
Yes, he was.
He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts.
To my father. Everything counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well, why does it?
Well, why does it?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask...
That's when he fell.
Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still lashed to the mast.
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.

Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?

Maybe...?
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.

Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
The knife. What knife?
Still a coincidence. Timing and all.
The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
He hit his head. On the way in.
You think so?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.

Well, anything coulda caused that.
Cigarette?
I'll take two. One for later.
If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. <u>You're</u> the story today.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We don't let go, you s...
It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point.
What for, Sheriff?
We have a warrant. To search your boat.
You always run with the well open?
I was checking the cables.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes.
Sure. Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there. In a half hour you could be in Canada.
What makes you think I play?
Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
White or black?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or hang back and wait.
You must think I like losing.
I think you like learning.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one.
Sure. I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You wouldn't even see it move.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity.
I should show them an American?
And what's that?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier. Like a samurai.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
You want me to say that.
I want you. To tell the truth.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad. And it's real.
I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad. And it's real.
And what do you believe?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Maybe.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?

Does it now?

A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.

He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.

But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.

No.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?

Apparently.
Apparently.
I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
I believe so.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
You don't. <u>Think</u> so.
You don't. <u>Think</u> so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
You don't. <u>Remember</u>.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>. Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Possible. But not darn likely.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.

<u>You</u> said that. That was <u>your</u> testimony.
So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?
As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Well...
Well...
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...?
In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Obviously.
Obviously.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.

For certain, no.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
For the third time, yes.
Can I say something, here?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?

So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...

Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.

That's all he said.
Improved...how?
As I said, in every way. Physically and psychologically. More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training. Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.

You know - the old shell game.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Wise guy, huh? Trying to louse me up -

Daphne got a proposal tonight.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So? It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire. That's life. You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.

I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.

Just the two of you? What about the crew?

Oh?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.

Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
We got it second-hand.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
We got time off for good behavior.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours. One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Tell what?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band. You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Yes. I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Where did he conduct?
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.

Oh.
Oh.
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.
Running away? From what?
Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.
